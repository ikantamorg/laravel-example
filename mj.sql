KAASH blends Indian melodies and sensibilities with a scorching Rock backbone, creating an ingenious sound, which emancipates a sea of emotions and nostalgia in the heart of its listeners.\r\n\r\nThe group released their first song “Main Laut Aaunga” in August 2009 which went on to become one of the most searched Hindi Rock tracks on the Internet with over 50 fan videos and more than 10,00,000 views. After that the band released 5 more tracks on the Internet which were received with even greater love and enthusiasm. Heart wrenching melodies, subtle lyrics, lavish ornamentation, and an unusual simplicity are their trademarks.\r\n\r\nThe band has built up a serious fan following online, with close to 2 lakh fans on their Facebook page. Several websites including reverbnation.com and indianrockmp3.com have ranked them as the No. 1 rock band in the country. Equally at home in a concert hall or a downtown club, KAASH embraces opportunities to bring their music to new listeners in non-traditional spaces. They have played to audiences throughout the country from Trivandrum to Guwahati to Jaipur and Delhi being their home crowd always greets them with the “loudest and proudest cheers”. The band has also shared the stage with some of the most renowned musicians in the world including Grammy winning Greek Bassist Panagiotis Andrew, Grammy nominated Mexican vocalist Magos Herrera and Slovenian jazz guitar legend Igor Bezget.  \r\nStatistics aside, KAASH’s indelible mark on the Independent Hindi Music has given it a dignity and a richness that it rightfully deserves. This Delhi band has tried to redefine Hindi Rock by distilling the purest essence of its rhythmic soul and infusing into it luminous production quality and equally stunning songs. \r\n\r\nKAASH is an eccentric set of five people Viren (vocals), Shivam (keyboards), Nishant (guitars), Sonic (bass), Nirvan (drums). Backed by solid education they show a marked disregard of any musical style limitations.\r\n\r\nKeyboardist Shivam Khare is a unique and well-rounded musician with a plethora of harmonic language that is very much audible in the music of KAASH. Adept at both western classical music and contemporary music he also studied Jazz at the prestigious jazz school SAM under New York based virtuoso pianist Jason Lindner, and was also adjudged as the “Most Distinguished Student”. Apart from being a gifted keyboard player he is also a composer and arranger.\r\n\r\nGuitarist Nishant Parashar is an intuitive musician whose instincts and passions are balanced by his versatility and technical dexterity. Tutored by the world famous Prasanna who has been complimented as “a living hope for quality music” by Academy Award winner A.R.Rahman and Berklee College of Music Guitar Department awardee Rubens de la Corte he believes that music is to be felt and connect with, and should never be filtered through a conscious mind.\r\n\r\nBass duties are with Sonic Shori who is again a student of Grammy-nominated Greek-American musician Panagiotis Andreou. He has comprehensive stage experience having collaborated with musicians coming from different genres including classical, fusion, funk and metal. His playing combines complexity with cohesion, playing melodies with a breathtaking dexterity, musicality and tenacity.\r\n\r\nThe youngest member of the band Nirvan Pareva is the man behind the drums. He has been coached by the immensely talented drum virtuoso Benny Greb. He recently won 2nd place at the Can-cercussonist Drummer Competition held in New Delhi. He has played with the likes of world-renowned fretless guitar player Ed De Generro and jazz legend Steve Zerlin.\r\n \r\nViren Saini is the vocalist of the band. He has an idiosyncratic style of writing beautiful songs using simple chord progressions and simple lyrics. He has no formal training in Music and considers Life as his teacher. His flair with words, his soulful voice and his unique song-writing skills are his assets. \r\n\r\nKAASH is a band blessed with both strength and intellect, architects of a true Hindi Rock sound they bring a sense of freshness and spontaneity. Their songs sound both honest and genuine; and have a sense of striking purity, undeniable magic and an unmistakable originality.\r\n\r\nOn a parting note Viren says,\r\n\r\n“We just love writing songs about how all of us feel.” \r\n','Achint Khare - 9891725153','http://www.facebook.com/kaashtheband','','http://soundcloud.com/kaashtheband','','0','205284',0,NULL,1,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-10-09 15:11:23',332,'[\"\"]','[\"\"]','kaash'),(4,0,0,0,'Astrix','FREE DOWNLOADS: \r\nT4N///001--- http://tiny.cc/51pgq \r\nT4N///002--- http://tiny.cc/bjt3k \r\nT4N///003--- http://tiny.cc/uuo2o \r\nT4N///004--- http://tiny.cc/qrew6 \r\nT4N///005--- http://tiny.cc/qb6ur \r\nT4N///006--- http://tiny.cc/imeis \r\nT4N///007--- http://tiny.cc/b19vg \r\nT4N///008--- http://tiny.cc/30peq\r\n\r\nAstrix\'s musical agenda is the ultimate clash, where underground vs. mainstream transforms to uplifting Trance composed with sophisticated melodies, a sprinkle of progressive House, and some occasional vocals. This audio clash is where Astrix\'s music have emerged from & been embraced by hundreds of thousands across so many nations and continents. As an incredibly popular DJ and producer, Avi Shmailov, aka Astrix, always thinks ahead how to tailor his sets and productions for his devoted fans, but not forgetting to please the casual dancers. Astrix needs to connect with everyone in the crowd, those who are unfamiliar with his works and at the same time with his followers throughout the years.\r\n\r\nRewind back to 2002, Astrix is signed to leading label HOMmega and is introduced to the world with his debut album \"Eye To Eye\". Things started to roll for Avi Shamilov from that point on, the world wide scene fell captivated with his unique, smart melodic style. Touring massively after the \"Eye To Eye\" album release didn\'t leave much studio time for Avi, it took two years to write & perfect his 2nd album, \"Artcore\" which came out in 2004. \"Artcore\" raised the bar with groundbreaking achievements if in CD sales, tracks used in movies, video games and TV commercials. \r\n\r\nOnce Astrix\'s musical sound got familiarized as his trademark, he turned to invest the years after to developing his DJ persona. Compiling & producing for leading brands such as: \"Nu-clear Visions of Israel\" (Tip/2003), \"Psychedelic Academy\" (Hit Mania/2005) and \"Astrix & Friends\" (DJ mag/2007). In 2009 Astrix\'s label, HOMmega productions, was the first to release an Astrix digital artist album, on a compact stick flash drive format, \"One Step Ahead\" (HOMmega/2009)\r\n\r\nEvolving into one the world known DJ MAG TOP 100 DJs placed Astrix on the roads for an almost nonstop world wide tour. He rocked festivals across the globe including Dance Valley, Tomorrowland, SW4, Creamfileds, Love Parade, UAF, Planeta Atlantida, Triba and headlined nights in the best clubs and venues such as Alexandra Palace, Brixton Academy, Pacha, Ministry of sounds, The City, Volume, Nox and so many more which he visited repeatedly .\r\n\r\nOver the last couple of years, studio time was a rare commodity for Avi Shamilov, but never the less he always managed to find the extra hours to work on releasing his 3rd studio album for HOMmega. ‘Red Means Distortion’ is the result of some very late night sessions, everything to reach the perfection he needed to return back to those who were waiting patiently for his 3rd album. \r\n \r\nStarting from August 2010, Astrix is releasing ongoing free download mix sessions under the title \"Trance for Nation\". As a well known \"global trance rocker\", stay tuned and expect nothing less then top notch trance productions!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.twitter.com/AstrixOfficial http://www.soundcloud.com/astrix-official http://www.youtube.com/ASTRIXtv \r\n','eyal@hommega.com ','http://www.facebook.com/Astrix.Official','','http://soundcloud.com/astrix-official','','0','192701',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','astrix'),(5,0,2,2,'Agnee','Agnee released their first album \"Agnee\" through Sony BMG in May 2007 and the album had some huge hits, including Sadho Re, Shaam Tanha and the MTV Roadies Theme Song.

Daniel Bedingfield, and “She Came Along” with Kid Cudi. His desire to not ever be confined and pigeon holed into one genre of music has enabled him to constantly evolve and surprise people with his productions. \r\n\r\nAnd the head turning has continued this year with his Mach EP releases which include  \"M.I.T.T.\", an underground favorite featuring a powerful vocal hook from Shakira, and “Fun” a song written by Chris Martin of Coldplay. His latest effort \"God Always\", a dub-step influenced house track was hailed as one of the runaway surprise records from the Miami Music Conference.\r\n\r\nThe Grammy Award winning producer’s DJ sets follow the diversity of his productions skills.

They did the rounds of college festivals, almost immediately becoming well known and popular, by winning three major rock competitions at the Kanpur, Delhi and Bombay IIT\'s. They signed a record deal and put out their first album (\'We Are Not Listening\') in 1996. It was listed by Rhythm House (India\'s premier record store) as the fastest selling rock album. They released two videos (\"The Ignorant 1\" and \"Yoo\") which were frequently played by all the music channels.\r\n\r\nPentagram were MTV India\'s \'Artist of the Month\' in 1997. They also won the Channel [V] awards for Best Live Band and Best Indian Band in 1997 & 1998.

The alternative rock band they had known had added a huge electronic edge to their sound. Pentagram have always maintained that the new sound came out of a burning need to find a way to make music that was uniquely and solely theirs. During the Kargil war, Pentagram recorded and released India\'s first exclusive-to-internet song, \'The Price of Bullets\', which featured famous poet Javed Akhtar and popular Indian Classical artist Shankar Mahadevan. The video, directed by Farhan Akhtar, one of India\'s most successful young film-makers, was blacked out by channels across the board for being \"too politically loaded\". It was added as a bonus track on their second album \'Up\'.\r\n\r\nThey became the first Indian Band to top Asian mp3.com charts with six songs going to No. 1 for over two weeks each. (\"Drive\", \"Strange\", \"Think of Me\", \"Don\'t Care\", \"Is there a Light?\", \"The Price of Bullets\" all featured on \'Up\'). Their single, \"Think of Me\", went to no. 5 in the world on Billboard\'s talent hunt site. \'Up\' was later released and published by their self owned music label, \'Pentagrammusic\', produced and distributed by Sony Music (India). It went on to become one of India\'s highest selling rock albums with more then 15,000 copies sold. A string of awards followed including Best Live Act at the June Rock Out awards in 2003, winning the readers poll for \'Best Indian Band\' by Rock Street Journal twice.\r\n\r\nTheir new edge brought them international recognition, in that the doors of several festivals were flung open to them. They headlined the Sundance Music Festival in Estonia in 2003, a first for any Indian band. They were also invited to, and played at the Glastonbury Music Festival in 2005. This was a real high point, as they not only became the first Indian Act to play there, but also became aware of the real possibilities of their music. They were able to share the stage with contemporary giants like Coldplay, Chemical Brothers, Tori Amos, Fat Boy Slim, White Stripes. Seeing how they stood up to huge acts, and how positive the audiences were, knee-jerked Pentagram into producing their current album. \'It\'s OK, It\'s All Good\', released by Counter Culture Records in March 2007, has been very well received. The first single off this album, \"Voice\", won the Song Of The Year at the recent Jack Daniel\'s Annual Indian Rock Awards the same night Vishal was awarded Vocalist Of The Year. Self assured, more mature, and yet, as edgy as ever, they hope to release this latest effort internationally, as well as tour the festival circuit far more aggressively.','bobby@oml.in, anirudh@oml.in','http://www.facebook.com/pentagramindia/info?ref=ts','http://www.pentagram.in','','','0','97045',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','pentagram'),(19,0,5,5,'Warpaint','Warpaint is an all-girl quartet from Los Angeles.  They weave intricate guitar lines, hypnotic vocals, and driving post-punk rhythms into gorgeous, sprawling songs that skirt the line between the soundscapes of psychedelia and intimacy.\r\n\r\nIn early 2009, their self-released debut EP \"Exquisite Corpse\" soared straight to #1 on legendary Los Angeles Amoeba Records’ local artists chart.  By September 2009, Manimal Vinyl reissued it on CD and vinyl, complete with a new bonus track, ‘Krimson’.  Mixed by John Frusciante (Red Hot Chili Peppers), the EP successfully captures the band’s sonic textures and playful dynamism that they’re notorious for creating in a live setting.  With a buzz already in the air, Warpaint is now beginning to stir the masses with praise in the US and abroad.  Dazed and Confused calls \"Exquisite Corpse\" \"a collection of magical psychedelia drifting over sublime moments of raw melody courtesy of the three free ethereal vocalists,” while The Independent adds, “They make a quite lovely sound with dreamy vocals, off-kilter hazy guitars.”\r\n\r\nOnstage, Warpaint’s disarmingly authentic package can shake a room into a dance frenzy, while simultaneously holding it in a trance-like dreamworld.  Playing to many captivated audiences, Warpaint has opened for Yeasayer, Black Heart Procession, and The Slits to name a few.  Warpaint took on a hectic 2009 fall touring schedule including a series of shows opening for Brooklyn-based trio School of Seven Bells, followed by numerous performances at CMJ Music Marathon, a series of headlining shows, and an opening spot for Band of Horses.\r\n\r\nThe band’s debut full-length album is due out on Rough Trade Records later this year.\r\n\r\nWarpaint is Emily Kokal (guitar/vocals), Theresa Wayman (guitar/vocals), Jenny Lee Lindberg (bass/vocals), and Stella Mozgawa (drums/keys/vocals).','US: Sonya Kolowrat - sonyakolowrat at beggars.com // Catherine Herrick - catherineherrick at beggars.com (online) // EU: Jamie Woolgar - jamiewoolgar at roughtraderecords.com // Ben Ayres - ben.ayres ','http://www.facebook.com/warpaintwarpaint/info','http://www.warpaintwarpaint.com','http://soundcloud.com/warpaintwarpaint','','0','94636',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','warpaint'),(20,0,5,14,'Pete Yorn','His fifth solo studio effort and Vagrant Records debut, Pete Yorn sees the Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter peeling away the baroque orchestrations of his critically acclaimed previous work to expose a beating rock ‘n’ roll heart.  Much of the eponymous album’s remarkable raw power comes courtesy of producer Frank Black, who in 2008 invited Yorn up to a Salem, Oregon studio for some spontaneous sessions.  The result is exuberant and edgy, with songs like “The Chase” and the album-opening “Precious Stone” ringing out loud and strong with chiming guitars, soaring harmonies, and Yorn’s soul-wrenchingly wrecked vocals.\r\n\r\n“It just makes me want to put my fist in the air,” Yorn says of the new album. “There’s something about it that’s really empowering.”\r\n\r\nThe album’s genesis came after a chance encounter with one of Yorn’s former A&R representative Nanci Walker.  Upon hearing some rough demos, Walker suggested the once-and-future Pixie as a potential producer.  Yorn – who thrives on collaboration, knowing that each new connection leads to fresh ideas – was certainly game.\r\n\r\n“I was like, yeah, I’d love to do some songs with Frank Black,” he recalls. “She said, ‘Well, let me see what I can do’ and that was the last we talked about it.  A couple of weeks later I got an e-mail from him, basically saying ‘Let’s rock.’”\r\n\r\nOne minor hitch:  the missive arrived mere weeks before Yorn was due in Omaha for sessions with producer Mike Mogis that would ultimately become 2009’s Back & Fourth.  Nevertheless, the offer was just too tempting to pass up.\r\n\r\n“ Frank Black is one of my heroes,” Yorn says, “I grew up a big fan of his work, so I was like, ‘Well, I’ve gotta do that.’  I just felt there was no way I could not take advantage of the opportunity.”\r\n\r\nAnd so, two weeks later, Yorn “snuck up to Oregon and made this little record.”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t concerned with the outcome,” he says.  “It was more about the experience.  I knew that I could go up there and possibly get nothing out of it, but I just thought it would be cool to go work with someone I really respect and  see what I could learn from him.”\r\n\r\nHaving had little personal interaction other than a few calls and e-mails, the two musicians met up in Yorn’s hotel room to discuss material and aesthetics.  Black’s idea was to strip Yorn’s atmospheric pop sound down to its bare bones, to create something more plainspoken than the carefully orchestrated arrangements of his prior work. \r\n\r\n“I usually like to add a lot of layers, production-wise, and he wanted none of it,” Yorn says.  “He was like, ‘No.  I just want your voice out there, fucked up and raw.  I don’t want a bunch of overdubs sucking away from your personality.’  He really believed that was the best way to present me.”\r\n\r\nWith a backing band comprised largely of Black’s own crack combo, Yorn cranked the record out quickly, laying it all down in a short, sharp five days.  His voice in ruins from a poorly timed case of flu, the singer/songwriter gave one of the most powerfully emotive vocal performances of his career.  But between the bad bug and Black’s new approach to recording, Yorn admits to feeling somewhat out of his comfort zone.\r\n\r\n“At first, it was kinda hard,” Yorn says.  \"I always hear so many different musical parts in my head.  But in hindsight, I remember listening to it on the flight home and thinking, wow, all the stuff that I was nervous about became my favorite things about it. It’s filled with imperfections, but I like that, it just seems more natural that way.”  \r\n\r\nSongs like “Future Life” and “Rock Crowd” are striking in their electric ebullience, especially in contrast to the darker songcraft featured on the haunting Back & Fourth.  Yorn suggests that while the character singing the “somber” songs on that album is “coming from a more remorseful, nostalgic place, the person singing the songs on this record is in a way better place.  He’s more empowered, he’s not worried about the past, he’s looking forward and he’s like, ‘Let’s go.’  It’s a totally different stance.”\r\n\r\nThat forward-looking approach could well define Yorn’s own recent prolificacy.  Pete Yorn marks his third release in just over a year, following his two acclaimed 2009 releases, Back & Fourth and Break Up, a musical alliance with Scarlett Johansson inspired by the classic duet recordings of Serge Gainsbourg & Brigitte Bardot (which was, in fact, recorded way back in 2006).  But the triumphant rock ‘n’ roll of Pete Yorn stands as the clearest distillation thus far of a restless creative spirit that simply can’t be contained.  Where Pete Yorn goes from here is anyone’s guess, least of all his own.\r\n\r\n“My attention to something runs high and then all of a sudden I’m into something else,” he says.  “That’s part of why I put out three records in a year and they’re all so different sounding.  I have to mix it up to stay inspired.”\r\n\r\nDiscography:\r\n\r\nMusicforthemorningafter 2001\r\nLive at the Roxy 2001\r\nDay I Forgot 2003\r\nLive from New Jersey 2004\r\nNightcrawler 2006\r\nBack & Fourth 2009\r\nBreak Up (with Scarlett Johansson) 2009\r\nPete Yorn 2010\r\n','Bobbie Gale Big Hassle Media Bobbie@bighassle.com ','http://www.facebook.com/peteyorn/info','http://www.peteyorn.com','http://soundcloud.com/pyorn','','0','94392',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','pete-yorn'),(23,0,15,16,'Yo!

It was a source of much inspiration to the musically aspiring pair; alongside Ritzy\'s parents enormous, exhaustive record collection. Nevertheless, in an otherwise provincial, sleepy setting, itchy feet and a fleeing were inevitable; Ritzy to Washington DC and Rhydian to Manchester, where they enjoyed separate but strangely parallel journeys as singer songwriters. It was a single phone call that reunited them, this time they would write together, but it was little known that a more intense partnership would develop between them.\r\n\r\nHundreds of miles away in similarly rural Devon, Justin had found solace in drumming and was preparing to move to London. He was distracted at first by actors and comedians, until he stumbled across the infancy of Ritzy and Rhydians writings.

Signed to WBR by Senior Vice President of A&R Kara DioGuardi (Fox’s American Idol, Bravo’s Platinum Hit), the Benny Blanco (Ke$ha, Wiz Khalifa, Katy Perry, Taio Cruz, Britney Spears) produced album is shaping up to be a collection of striking songs that deploy Neon\'s soulful, jazz-inflected vocals atop an organic backdrop of eclectic pop melodies and hip-hop tinged beats. \r\n\r\n2011 was the year Neon Hitch began to take off. Her online profile blew up thanks to a series of well received new songs like “Bad Dog” and “Poisoned With Love” and a series of hip hop cover videos where she put her unique spin to hit songs from Kreayshawn, Wiz Khalifa, Waka Flocka Flame and Mac Miller. The New York Post is on board early; they believe “Neon Hitch has all the elements of an A-list female pop queen.” Spin.com predicts to “expect household name status by year’s end.” \r\n\r\n2012 will be the year Neon Hitch explodes. Neon is featured on the Gym Class Heroes smash single “Ass Back Home,” one of the hottest songs in the country. She’s already performed the song on The Today Show, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, VH1’s Superbowl Fan Jam and Dick Clark’s New Years Rockin Eve. On the heels of this success, Neon is ready to unleash her debut single. Neon Hitch would like the world to know that she can \"Fuck U Betta.\" The electric Benny Blanco produced track is the first official single off Neon\'s debut album Beg, Borrow and Steal, which will be out this summer.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a great talent, Neon has an amazing back story. As a kid, she grew up on a bus, travelling the world as a trapeze artist and street performer. BBC even did a documentary on her life. At age 10, Neon began writing poetry, which led to her writing lyrics. Over the next handful of years, Neon found herself traveling with friends all over Europe, and living in squats in London while trying to pursue a singing career. In 2007, she signed to The Streets\' Mike Skinner\'s indie label The Beats Recordings (a subsidiary of Atlantic\'s 679 Recordings) and went on tour with Skinner. She performed her first major show opening for rapper 50 Cent at England\'s Nottingham Arena before the label shut down in 2007. Since then, she\'s worked with artists ranging from William Orbit and Rodney Jerkins to Miike Snow (appearing on Blanco\'s remix of \"Burial\"). She also co-wrote the iTunes No. 1 single \"Blah Blah Blah\" on Ke$ha\'s No. 1 album Animal.\r\n\r\n‘I want to be the kind of artist that people feel like they can relate to,” Neon says. “Maybe my music will make them feel a bit less lonely. They may not be able to relate to my story, but they’ll be able to relate to me as a person. The album is going to be me, inside and out, because I’m a very honest person. I’ve been through so many bad patches, but having the opportunity to do this makes it seem like it all happened for a reason. I want people to know that, yeah, times are tough, but you know what? There’s a light at the end of the tunnel.

It is in two words, bewitching and addictive.\r\n\r\n“Singer-songwriters always get criticised – fairly – for sometimes sounding like a scratched record,” says Greenall. “…moaning about this, moaning about that, girlfriend’s left you, blah blah, blah.  With Fink we do sing about relationships and love and emotions – but we also sing about other stuff: embracing fear, Berlin dawns, looking forward. Perfect Darkness was written about a friend of mine who’s just signed a massive record deal and it’s all about to kick off. And I’m saying, ‘just roll with it man. It’s gonna get dark but you’ll survive and you’ll come out the other side.’ “\r\n\r\nFollowing three critically-acclaimed albums, ‘Perfect Darkness’ marks the next chapter of an incredible musical journey for the Bristol-born artist. The first and pre-eminent singer-songwriter signed to legendary British label Ninja Tune - after making the transition from world-clas club DJ and electronic producer - Fink is also an in-demand collaborator having written for the likes of John Legend, Ximena Sarinana, Amy Winehouse and Professor Green. He has also graced some of the world’s most prestigious stages, and with bandmates Guy Whittaker on bass and Tim Thornton on drums, has toured the globe several times over.\r\nUp until now Fink has remained in the shadows, working quietly and diligently in the background, but judging by this new record he is set to emerge into the bright lights of long-deserved mass recognition. \r\n\r\nTitle track “Perfect Darkness” available now as a free download at http://www.finkworld.co.uk.\r\n\r\n ','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Flink/153942351287773?sk=info','http://www.flink.ch','www.soundcloud.com/flinkmusic','','0','58398',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','fink'),(37,0,18,18,'Asian Dub Foundation (Official)','ALL BIOGRAPHY IS NOW IRRELEVANT!

The esoteric (but learned) ability to infuse those proceedings with melody, song-craft and memorable structure is another feat entirely. It\'s a precise and deadly combination of skill sets.\r\nIn this lofty pursuit, The Human Abstract stands mightily. The Human Abstract stands alone.\r\nThe Los Angeles musical alchemists have perfected their art through careful distillation of their many talents with their third and astoundingly impressive full-length album (and first through eOne), Digital Veil.\r\n\"The emphasis on melody and the thematic material on the album is what may set us apart,\" offers guitarist / co-songwriter A.J. Minette, who returned to The Human Abstract for Digital Veil after an absence spent studying classical music at university. \"Some of my favorite composers, like Chopin, are also great tunesmiths. Not only are his harmonies great but his melody is topnotch.\"\r\nHarmony, melody, classical infusions and breakneck anthemic metal collide across a wide spectrum of compositions throughout Digital Veil. The opening track alone boasts four part guitar harmonies, two classical guitars and a diverse array of color and textures not normally found in the genre. Careening unfettered into territories both familiar and unknown, the record makes its way to album closer \"Patterns,\" possessed with a particular chromatic harmony that will challenge, unnerve and ultimately empower while lyrically exploring ideas about identity, personal transformation and purpose.\r\nThe talent on display from guitarists Dean Herrera and Minette invigorates what has become a stagnant genre with a fresh injection, whether meshing alongside or intriguingly combating the rhythms scattered and gathered by bassist Henry Selva and drummer Brett Powell. New vocalist Travis Richter (ex-From First To Last) brings an all new passion to the forefront, dedicating his throat to the forward-thinking task of uniting the various elements of the band behind unmistakable hooks.\r\n\"The music scene is all survival of the fittest these days,\" Richter explains. \"If you\'re willing to go the extra mile and build something special around your skill level or your melodies, then you\'re delivering something potent and powerful. The glory of the age we live in is you can get that out to everyone.\"\r\nThe version of The Human Abstract responsible for Digital Veil and who will present songs both new and old onstage going forward is functioning at heretofore uncharted levels of intensity and magic thanks to a convergence of events that couldn\'t have been planned and yet couldn\'t have worked out any more to their advantage. The reunion of founding guitarists Herrera and Minette was a stroke of divine providence, as was the recruitment of Richter last year.\r\nHerrera and Minette assembled the first version of The Human Abstract in 2004 with Powell, their original bassist and two different singers before the recording of their debut album, Nocturne (2006). It was after touring in support of that album that Minette felt called to broaden his horizons as a player and songwriter, choosing to explore a classical education. The Human Abstract went on to release Midheaven (2008) without him, further cementing the band\'s ever widening international fan base. Selva became the band\'s permanent bass player early the following year after a stint as a fill-in player.\r\nAs the band started to look toward writing their third album they reached out to their old friend Minette, who was finishing his last year in music school. \"They asked initially if I would come onboard to help with preproduction and stuff like that,\" he explains. \"Once I started working with the guys again it was a lot of fun. The more I thought about putting my name on the album, I wanted it to be something I believed in solidly. I started having more input on the writing and I just transitioned into being a member of the band again. I was studying classical music and I felt like that artistic side of me was satisfied. It allowed me to let the metal band be a metal band and enjoy that while still utilizing some of the classical sensibility.\"\r\nAround the same time the group was having discussions about replacing their lead singer. \"I was on the same page as them. I thought it was a smart idea,\" Minette says. \"It\'s very difficult for any audience to understand the internal things that go on inside a band. Part of that is because we don\'t air those problems in detail. But there needed to be a change for the band to continue. It was absolutely crucial.\"\r\nTravis Richter knew the guys from years of traveling in the same circles on the road. From First To Last experienced numerous ups and downs throughout their career including Richter\'s own transition from guitarist to frontman. \"When I left From First To Last I instantly tried out to be in The Human Abstract,\" he says, pointing out that he went through the same audition process as other singers. \"I sang over a song of theirs. They liked what I sent them and asked me to sing over a new song. I recorded that and sent it back and they were really interested in hearing more. They flew me out to LA. I\'ve been here ever since!\"\r\n\"He has a lot of things that he can do vocally,\" Minette says. \"We leaned on Travis a lot for the morale of the band. Now it feels like a family. It\'s a bunch of friends instead of just a bunch of co-workers.\"\r\nOne of the standout tracks on the filler-free Digital Veil, \"Faust,\" serves as the perfect reintroduction of The Human Abstract. \"It\'s the song on the record that has just a little bit of everything,\" says Richter.\r\nAs a guitar player himself, Richter says he\'s been taking lessons from Minette from time to time. But their shared interest in precision and melody hasn\'t stopped the band from stomping straightforwardly when necessary. The album\'s title track is a straight-up barnburner. \"There\'s no singing. It\'s all screaming. It\'s more of an intense, traditional heavy metal song,\" Richter says. \"It uses a lot of theory but none of it is necessarily based on melody, aside from the fact that it\'s written inside of a scale.\"\r\nThe Human Abstract has built a formidable reputation with their two prior full-length albums and nonstop road work touring with bands like As I Lay Dying, All That Remains and The Devil\r\nWears Prada as well as festival packages like Vans Warped Tour and the Take Action! Tour. Undeniably Digital Veil will up the ante for their profile with fans and critics alike and the present incarnation is insanely impressive live.\r\n\"The band is trying to just keep things really simple from a career perspective and make everything about the art and the music,\" Richter says. \"That\'s a big thing for us. Even when we\'re rehearsing we\'re being very serious with it and slowing things down and making sure everything is performed properly. It\'s all about being able to deliver a skill to where people can see something in you and geek out on it. If you want your band\'s longevity and impact to be based on more than trends, you have to deliver a real skill.\"','','http://www.facebook.com/thehumanabstract/info','http://pullmefromthegallows.com','','','0','50173',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','the-human-abstract'),(45,0,1,1,'The Avalanches','The Avalanche was formed in December 2008.\r\n\r\nThe band did its 1st gig at campus rock idols 2009.\r\nBand Achievements : \r\nIndependence Rock XXVI\r\nCampus Rock Idols Edition 5 (Regional Finalist) \r\nYouth Nexus 2011 (Finalists)\r\nYamaha Asian Beats( Short listed for Delhi beat)\r\nShivaji College Thunderstruck 2011(Winner)\r\nLBSIM Fort Rock - Tatva 2011(Winner)Dwarka Campus\r\nLBISM COLLEGE 2010 (Winner) ( R.K.

Motherjane was formed to fill in for the Professional act which had suddenly opted out of the Rock show. The first stroke of luck for Motherjane had sounded!\n\nIn 1996, featuring the combined talents of John Thomas(Drums), Clyde Rozario (Bass), Mithun (Guitars) and Laji (Vocals), the band went on to make an explosive debut wowing their peers within a week of their formation.\n\nIn 1997, Motherjane released a 3 song EP that got lost amongst the wilderness of Kerala, where many a poterntaily great rock bands got lost in the 80s and 90s.\n\nMotherjane then went thru the agonizing process of losing the talents of 2 of its founding members who went in pursuit of their individual dreams. By 1999 the mercurial and talented Baiju took over duties as axeman &, Motherjane entered a partial state of limbo becoming a 3 member team with John & Clyde still holding on.\n\nFor over a year the band played metal songs (without a vocalist!) at The Ancient Mariner” a floating restaurant in Kochi to an unsuspecting & astounded audience that walked into the quaint pier like structure built in the backwaters.\n\nIn 2000, then a young businessman by the name of Suraj Mani, chanced into “The ancient mariner” and egged on by his friend, jammed with the band. Almost coincidently at the same time a talented young guitarist called Rex also moved into this loosely bound group.\n\nWithin a week of juggling his time between work and music, Suraj was already trying to move on. Attempting to excuse himself with an observation on the lack of future that confronts cover bands, his proposed exit lines were, “If we were making our own music, it would mean something. At least then 10 years down the line, we can’t be just replaced by the next band of talented young musicians who would play these covers with more energy.” Baiju looked up and said, “lets make a song”\n\nThat moment for any band heralds its real beginning. By 2001-02 the band had composed, performed and recorded 9 songs in an album that they called “insane biography”. During this period, the band was already coping with the logistical horrors of practice & recording, since Suraj had shifted base to Bangalore. Overcoming its difficulties, the band went on to perform all over the Indian sub continent gaining from strength to strength and winning numerous competitions and awards. Most notable amongst them in the first half of band’s career was the award for best Indian rock album in the year 2002-03.\n\nMotherjane, (the band’s guardian angel- named in homage to the bands belief that music is by far the best and purest drug in the world) was making her presence felt and her sons heard!\n\nThen Rex left in 2002. It was the day before the Great Indian Rock concert, where for the first time a band from the serene and lost state of Kerala had managed to break into. The band was lost again.\n\nFor 2 years the band went thru stand in guitarists for their rhythm section, all the while performing, learning and growing in stature. Amidst all the turmoil, Insae Biography was creating ripples in the rock circuit. The band’s album became the first Indian rock album to be featured in international radio stations across 3 continents. The song Soul Corporations was bought for an international compilation album “Geki Teki Metal” released in Japan in 2004. Motherjane’s live acts were getting rave reviews across the country. DNA networks rated the band as one of the top 3 live acts in the country. Always working for the inevitable success that they craved, Motherjane welcomed Deepu in late 2004. Once again the vibe was back and within 6 months the band was composing new material.\n\nThe band will be bringing out their new album titled “Maktub” in 2007 and has further developed their sound into something that is uniquely Motherjane and attracts a cult following amongst the thinking rocker. The songs from the latest recordings got the boys laurels with Baiju winning the award for the guitarist of the year 2007 at the JD Tennesse Annual Rock awards and Suraj being nominated for the vocalist of the year. What most bands from the so-called rock hubs of India could not achieve in years in the Indian rock circuit, Motherjane - a band hailing from the remotest islands of Kerala did so in no time with their perseverence, thereby, becoming an inspiration for most rock bands that have gained fame over the last few years.\n\nMotherjane’s fascinating musical style flows with the melody of rural India, seethes with the raw aggression of rock and is inlaid with lyrics of exquisite insight .The band is going to re-record “insane biography” along with “Maktub” as a special tribute to its fans.\n\nIf there is one thing that Motherjane has lived by, it is the gut feeling that success is more about what one overcomes than just achievements.\n\nThis band has overcome much more than the milestones it is known for and is still growing stronger and stronger on its journey to reach its world wide audience.\n\nIt seems apt here to leave with the lyrics of “walk on” from the album “Insane Biography”-\n\n“I’m the immortal, baptized in fire\nUnable to die unless I desire\nI’m the light piercing the darkest dawn\nI’m the human spirit, walking on.”\n\nWelcome to the band .\n','Eva Dowd ; eva@evadowd.com','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Motherjane/10612624134','http://www.motherjane.org/','http://soundcloud.com/motherjane','http://www.reverbnation.com//motherjaneo...','10612624134','2351',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','motherjane'),(48,0,2,1,'DJ DEV','His friends call him SUPER BOY & others call him \r\nTHE BOY WONDER ...\r\n\r\nTouring at this young age All across Asia, Middle East & India !!\r\nHis music has taken over the Remix music industry by storm & has given it a new term of\r\nElectronic Bollywood Music since his arrival in 2007\r\n\r\nWith so many accolades like Winner of ---\r\nWorld DJ Federation\'s - Battle of DJ\'s 2004\r\n\"Allzure\" World Spinmaster Championship, Hong Kong 2006\r\n\'Zee Muzic Best DJ/Producer for 2007\'\r\nLive @ MTV Asia Awards 2008 crew party in Bangkok, Thailand\r\n\r\nHe is now an unstoppable force, with his Remixes getting banged in Radio Stations like\r\nRadio 1190\" -Colorado, USA, Masters of the Mix \"City 101.6 FM\" -Dubai,\r\nKlub Nine \"91.9 FM\" -Siliguri, BBC-Radio1 -UK, “Lotus FM” Klub Kulcha -South Africa,\r\nHKGFM -Hong Kong, Curry Smugglers -USA & many more...\r\n\r\nOVER 1 MILLION Downloads & still on & \r\nperformed in Top clubs with packed audiences —\r\n\r\nBangkok, Thailand\r\nSeoul, Korea\r\nDubai, U.A.E\r\nHong Kong, China\r\nBaharain, Kingdom of Baharain\r\nColombo, Sri Lanka\r\nKenya, Nairobi\r\n\r\nMumbai\r\nGoa\r\nLucknow\r\nHyderabad\r\nNoida\r\nGurgaon\r\nKolkata\r\nSurat\r\nOrissa\r\nChennai\r\nBangalore\r\nMangalore\r\nJaipur\r\nPune\r\n& the list goes on..\r\n\r\nHe has Remixed Officially for top notch International Singers/Artists which is rare for an Indian DJ !!\r\nThe name goes as Jay Sean, Raghav Mathur, Tigerstyle, Taz (Stereo Nation),\r\nKaren David, The Bilz & Kashif (Canada), Shibani Kashyap, Alisha Chinoy, RDB (Manj), Bhangra Bros.,\r\nKunal Ganjawala, Sunidhi Chauhan, Jaz DHami (UK), G3 & Navin Kundra.\r\n\r\nExpect his music everywhere if it\'s a Desi-party in any part of the world..

It was an amateurish first attempt but a bold step in a scene dominated by tribute and cover bands that got Demonic Resurrection noticed. As with most bands, teething problems meant that members came and went, and the first stable lineup came together only in 2001 with Demonstealer on vocals and guitars, Count Varathora on bass, Nikita Shah on vocals and keyboards and Yash Pathak on the drums. The band re-recorded Demonstealer with the current lineup. Though a marked improvement on the original recording, the band was still experimenting with its sound and recording, something that comes across clearly on the album. It was still amateurish but it received a fair bit of acclaim and Brazilian record label Vampiria Records released a tape version of the album in the local market. (Today though, copies of this album are collectors’ items.) \r\nHowever in 2002, the band fell apart, leaving the Demonstealer to build it back up from scratch. Resurrected in 2003 with a brand new-lineup, Demonic Resurrection was now Husain Bandukwala (bass), Mephisto (keyboards), JP (drums) and the Demonstealer (vocals, guitars). The band spent the next two years writing new material that reflected the change in lineup and each band member brought a different flavour to the music. Gone was the gothic/black/death metal sound of the band to now be replaced by a meld of equal parts melody and brutal aggression, the sound of their second album A Darkness Descends. The album was released in October 2005 to critical acclaim from all over the world (popular metal webzine Metal Observer rated it a 9 on 10) and till today is a benchmark release in the history of Indian metal. The album also gave birth to Demonstealer Records, an independent extreme metal record label launched by the Demonstealer, which would go on to release albums of all the top Indian metal bands. Looking to add yet more depth and dimension to their sound, the band enlisted lead guitarist Pradeep Pande in 2006 but the same year also saw the exit of drummer JP. This however didn’t stop DR from getting into the studio and recording their EP and third studio effort Beyond The Darkness, which featured on a split CD titled Rise Of The Eastern Blood along with bands Dusk from Pakistan and Severe Dementia from Bangladesh. Since the band had no drummer, Demonstealer took up the drum duties for the EP. Beyond the Darkness saw a slightly more experimental side of the band, adding ambience and spacey, ethereal textures to their sound. And while some fans were skeptical of the musical direction the band had taken, critics applauded it, heaping praise on the band. \r\nThat Indian metal and Demonic Resurrection in particular were on their way to global recognition became amply clear when filmmaker Sam Dunn (Metal: A Headbanger’s Journey, Iron Maiden: Flight 666) featured the band in his landmark documentary Global Metal. Demonic Resurrection was also the only Indian band to make it to the soundtrack of Global Metal along with the likes of Lamb of God, Sepultura and In Flames.\r\nThe band meanwhile continued to hunt for a new drummer until August 2007 when Virendra ‘Viru’ Kaith joined the band. Over the next year or so the band continued touring and writing new material till Pradeep quit in 2008 and was replaced by guitar prodigy Daniel Rego who was just 18 years old. 2009 saw the band widen the scope of their tours across India, going places that no Indian metal band had gone before and featuring as the support acts for Opeth in February 2009 and for Amon Amarth and Textures in December 2009.\r\nThe band hit the studio in August 2009 to record their third full-length album and what was to be the final chapter in the Darkness trilogy: The Return to Darkness. Roping in renowned artist Michael ‘Xaay’ Lorac (Nile, Karl Sanders, Behemoth, Vader) to design the artwork for the album, the band also released their first video for ‘The Unrelenting Surge of Vengeance’ that received (and continues to receive) airplay from mainstream music channels like VH1. The album was officially released in January 2010 followed by a nationwide tour ¬¬– The Resurrection Festival. The band capped 10 successful years of metal with their first international show at the prestigious Inferno Festival in Norway in April 2010 and and followed it up with appearance at the Brutal Assault festival in the Czech Republic in August 2010. The band also picked up the Metal Hammer Golden God Award for Global Metal in June 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s been a long and sometimes arduous 10-year journey for the band – a story of struggle, brickbats, bottles, adulation and acceptance but most of all of incredible amounts hard work, determination and perseverance – and even naysayers will be hard-put to argue that DR are one of the most important bands to have come out of the Indian music scene.

Originating from Nepal, she comes to the table with a charismatic persona and a unique sound backed by her acoustic guitar. Having been continuously songwriting since the age of 14, Astha now has an array of songs which all hold meaning and speak of a deep truth.\r\n\r\nGraduating from the Independent Music Production program at Toronto’s Seneca College (2008), she developed the necessary skills to begin her career as an Independent artist. She has performed at numerous Toronto music venues such as the Smiling Buddha, the Reverb, Holy Joes, the Horseshoe Tavern, Tranzac and the Opera House to name a few. She has also performed at multiple music festivals in Nepal such as Fête de la Musique, the Chevrolet Miles Music Festival and the Himalayan Blues Festival.\r\n\r\nWhen given the opportunity to travel back to Nepal, she took advantage of it, and released a Nepali debut album, “Sabai Thikai Huncha” in January 2009 (Kathmandu). Independently released by Astha, the album is a mix of acoustic, live and electronic music, with 1 English and 7 Nepali songs co-written by Astha and her mother Susan Maskey. Working closely with Astha was a 22 year old production genius named Rohit Shakya who brilliantly produced all the songs on the project. Also featured on the album are prominent Nepalese musicians such as: Rizu Tuladhar (Looza) on bass, Abishek Bhadra (JSC Trio) on keys, and Prazol Raj Kanskar (Looza) on drums.\r\n\r\nHer first radio single off the Nepali album, “Gotta be love” received a significant amount of plays charting at number 1 on the Nepalese FM stations. Her second radio hit, “Jhuto Satya” received a nomination for “Best Rock Vocal Performance” on the Nepalese TV-Image Award 2009. Recently, Astha was awarded the \"Best Pop Female Vocalist\" award at Radio Kantipur\'s Music Honours - 2010 (Kathmandu).\r\n\r\nBack in Toronto now, Astha just released her debut English EP - 11:11. Young and driven, she has realized that a career in music is her ultimate passion. For one so young, her voice resonates with confidence. Astha - the name itself means to have faith, and her faith is in her music.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Astha has that rare gleaming charm to herself which allures even grown up men to listen to her pretty yet powerful voice singing of teenage angst and puppy love lost.” – Republica Newspaper- Nepal\r\n\r\n“She is a gifted singer with a fairly versatile voice. She sounds as good singing ballads over acoustic guitar in the title track as she does while packing heavy pop singles” – Y!

Drummer Matt Schulz and bass player Matt McQuaid provide a complex rhythm foundation that at times feels like an invisible hand leading you through a dark hedge maze. Perhaps an excessive feat for most, but this provides the ideal underpinning as Brian Borcherdt and Graham Walsh merge a twin effects/feedback tangle that is equal parts entrancing and inspiring. \r\n\r\nThe band had an absurdly busy touring schedule in 2008/2009 and Latin undoubtedly benefited from the near nightly shows. There is an added dimension of song craft on the album – Latin brings noise and melody together with an uncanny sense of optimism – but at the same time Holy Fuck have not lost the chaotic and euphoric energy that they are known for.\r\n\r\nWhen it came time for Holy Fuck to record, songs were cut live off the floor during their brief downtime at home. Delivered in trimesters, Latin was engineered by Graham Walsh and mixed by Dave Newfeld (Broken Social Scene), D. Sardy (Johnny Cash, NIN), Eli Janney (GvsB, Wilco,), Paul Epworth (Bloc Party, Primal Scream) and Holy Fuck themselves.  It’s the follow up to 2007’s simply titled LP which Filter described as “nine perversely noisy, mind-bogglingly ferocious freakouts” and Spin said of it “Holy Fuck play the sort of id-gripping dance rock that’s best experienced in person. Luckily (LP) retains the raw energy of the live show, even without the visual barrage.”\r\n\r\nWith high praise from peers, critics, big name endorsements and ascension on festival bills, Holy Fuck have the divine right to be profane. And with respected music luminaries Thom Yorke and Lou Reed passing on kind words about studio recordings and live performances, it’s no wonder Holy Fuck have become sought after.

DJ Suketu.\r\n\r\nA Times Music discovery way back in 2001, he has churned out some of the most successful and loved remixes of all time. His skills were nurtured by 4 times UK champion and 2 times world champion DJ Cut Master Swift at the DMC (Disco Mixing Club) headquarters in Burnham. Soon after this DJ Suketu went on to win the DMC in 1999 and became the number 1 DJ in Mumbai and India and represented India in the World DJ Mixing Championships in New York.\r\n \r\nHe released his first album \'440 Volts\' in 2002. His single \'Pyar Zindagi Hai\' entered the charts at no.1 and parked itself there for 8 weeks. He followed it up with \'Bin Tere Sanam\' which is his wildly successful party anthem . \'Bin Tere Sanam\' was an overnight sensation. It debuted at number 1 on the Indi pop charts and stayed there for 20 weeks!  It was one of the most frequently played tracks in nightclubs all over not only India but the world and can be rightfully called the remix of the decade. Later that year, the track was recognised as the highest selling remix in the history in Indian music and was awarded the Best Remix Of the year by MTV India.\r\n \r\nDJ Suketu has worked with many composers on numerous projects. Among a few are Pritam, Adnan Sami, Shankar Ehsan Loy, Himesh Reshamiya and Vishal Shekhar. He collaborated with composer and singer Atif Aslam in 2004 to recreate \'Woh Lamhe\' a song from the movie Zeher. The recreation become a sensation, an anthem of sorts once again. \'Woh Lamhe\' wasn\'t just the biggest remix of year, it remains timeless and an eternal favourite of millions. 2004 was a double whammy year for DJ Suketu with the release of \'Kya Khoob Lagati Ho\' another chartbuster . Along with fame and fan following came the respect and adulation of the music industry. He was awarded by HMV Sa Re Ga Ma and Vishesh Films for making the highest selling Bollywood Film remix for \'Woh Lamhe\'. He went on to win the MTV IMMIES 2005 in the Best Remix/Pop music category for Kya Khoob Lagti Ho.\r\n\r\nAfter the success of Woh Lamhe DJ Suketu has worked with Vishesh films on almost all of their films, assuring them of a stellar soundtrack. His recreations of songs in Kalyug and Awarapan became a rage. \'Aadat\' from Kalyug was once again the highest selling remix of 2005. With his 3 remixed tracks from the film Awarapan, namely \'Toh Phir Aao\', \'\'Tera Mera Rishta and \'Mahiya\',  Suketu set a new standard of excellence. All tracks became super hits and were well received by the industry.\r\n\r\nThis wasn\'t it for Suketu. He was soon invited to be a celebrity guest and judge on National Television (Sony TV) to judge the remix round of the reality show K for Kishore. Not only did he judge the show amongst respected musicians like Bappi Lahiri, Amit Kumar and Sudesh Bhosle but he also did all the remixes on which the singers sang and so did the 3 judges.\r\nIn 2008, Bandya Ho remixed by Suketu, from the international award winning film Khuda Ke Liye (In The Name Of God) became a big hit all over the world.\r\nDJ Suketu also remixed songs for classical maestros like Rahul Shiv Kumar Sharma and Richard Clayderman called \'The Chase\' from the album \'Confluence 2\'.\r\nDJ Suketu had the honor of remixing a track by world renowned Sarangi player and composer Ustad Sultan Khan. The song was called \'Maula\' from the album \'Gurus In Collaboration.\r\nHe also won the Desi hits competition to re-mix Sean Kingston\'s Beautiful Girl\'s desi version called Bollywood Girls.

Bhayanak Maut (\'Terrible Death\' in Hindi) hails from Mumbai, the metal capital of India. And alongside other local metal bands, Bhayanak Maut paved the way for the New Wave of Indian Metal. All this, while laying waste to some of India\'s biggest cities and creating a fan base that\'s unheard of in the Indian scene.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by everyone, from local metal acts to international metal giants, Bhayanak Maut created a signature metal sound for itself. In its 6 years of existence, the band has played at some of the biggest gigs in the country, including, Independence Rock, Great Indian Rock festival and Channel [v] Launchpad. Not to mention the band\'s DIY attitude has helped them put out a full-length album and also made them a part of  many Indian Metal Compilations. Their EP – Malignant, featured in FINE TUNED DISASTERS, a compilation, decapitated a couple of hundred fans.\r\n\r\nLead by Vinay and Sunny on vocals, Bhayanak Maut creates an honest yet brutal wall of music for people to pummel into. Their music is a blend of metal, hardcore and grind elements with groove. The twin-guitar attack of Aditya and Venky rips through with unparalleled veracity while being as vicious as possible. Rahul and Swapnil, on drums and bass respectively, boom their way through any problem while being Bhayanak Maut\'s titanium pillars.\r\n\r\nMore than anything, Bhayanak Maut thrives on playing live. Their epic stage act is already the stuff of legends. And the fun bit is that they take it a notch higher every time they get on stage. While the audience stays on their toes, witnessing a new Bhayanak Maut at every show.\r\n\r\nThe Bhayanak Maut evolution looks like it\'ll never stop and hopefully, it won\'t, for they\'re India\'s hope amongst a couple of other bands in the international scene.\r\n\r\n','Rahul - +91 9821638179  | Siddhartha +91 9999973477 sid@bhayanakmaut.com','http://www.facebook.com/bhayanakmaut/info?ref=ts','http://www.bhayanakmaut.com','http://soundcloud.com/bhayanakmaut','','0','28230',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','bhayanak-maut'),(63,0,31,31,'Antim Grahan','Forever Winter (2004)\r\nTales From The Darkened Woods (2005)\r\nIn Thy Ambience of Malevolence (2007)\r\nThe Ruin Of Immortals (2009)\r\nPutrefaction Eternity (2010)','','http://www.facebook.com/grahan.antim/info','','','','0','27277',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','antim-grahan'),(64,0,34,34,'Powersurge','A masterpiece of modern Thrash Metal in Bangladesh where Guitars rip, drums pound, bass thunders and lyrics resonate as the group of five soars from Dhaka, Bangladesh to be defined as the Powerhouse of Dhaka – POWERSURGE!!! It is a glittering explosion of neck-snapping riffs, grandiose melodious choruses and outstanding musicianship from all five members of the band. And with good reason; to witness Powersurge live is to understand both their unique internal chemistry with savage thrash intricacy and riffage and the undeniable bond that the band shares with its audience which ultimately crashes HEAD FIRST into bludgeoning head banging. With a performance that has been honed and strengthened through all over the country, Powersurge are touted by many as the most energetic live band in Bangladesh Metal.\r\n\r\nIn January 2006, NAHIAN a.k.a SCHIZO, aligned with Drummer SAMIUL ISLAM to form a thrash metal band from various American and German thrash/heavy influences. After the initial forming, the band had settled the other members by March 2006 starting with JAMSHED CHOWDHURY who delivers a hitherto unheard depth and maturity with his throats. NAHIAN and his six-string counterpart SAMIR HAFIZ KHAN have reached a new plateau of blurred-finger brilliance, with instantly memorable riffs and ear-searing fret-melting solos where Samir delivers the divine melodious licks. When Schizan Shahed Antu joined to pick up the bass duties for the group, the band was finally complete. The band immediately started performing in underground shows, where they were gaining rapid popularity because of their aggressive style and vicious stage acts. The underground crowds were overwhelmed and accepted Powersurge’s Thrash dominion for their rock solid performances and song qualities. In the mid 2006 Powersurge had their 1st single “Durboddho Monushotto” released in a mixed band compilation album “Underground”, where the song itself was much more of an experimental track apart from the Powersurge thrash style. Now, the band was getting forward with seemly success in the underground gigs, while the huge was yet to come.\r\n\r\nIn January 2007 Antu was kicked out of the band because of his insincerity towards his work and pestiferous attitude towards the other members and within a short time Farhan Abedin was assigned for the bass duties and the band continued ruling. In April 2007, the band participated in Grameen Phone Djuice Drockstars2, one of the biggest reality Musical Band hunt shows to take place in the country’s history. The band started acquiring huge success and feedback from the whole nation, slowly planting thrash seeds in millions. Meanwhile, in May 2007, whilst the Drockstar competition was running, Farhan had to quit the band for his higher education out of Bangladesh, so AREFIN AHMED SAEED, a previous ally of Nahian in their other Brutal Death Metal band SEVERE DEMENTIA, joined the band permanently. With the new upgraded bass line up, Powersurge exceeded powerfully in the contest. With the aid of Nahian’s technical and amazing riffs, Samir’s blistering solos and shredding, Jamshed’s unique voice and lyrics throw and of course the steady and quality head crashing Thrash blasts of Samiul attained the band to become the Champions of DRockstars2.\r\n\r\nThe band was now an icon in both the underground and mainstream scenes. Powersurge previously being famous in the underground gigs now having huge mainstream support and fan base in the midst of the competition as the show was broadcasted on the national TV- channel I. This was also fulfilling the sole motto of the band- that is to build a firm and solid spot for Thrash metal music in Bangladesh. Now, after achieving the ultimate success in earning a massive number of fans who would never miss a Powersurge show.The Band has released its first full length album titled \"Auprostut Juddho\" on September 2008 . And it has been very much apprehended which  created a milestone in the history of Bangladesh by creating Thrash Metal Music a major part of the Bangladeshi Music. . It\'s an obscenely brave and ambitious end to a glorious collection of songs that seems destined to cement Powersurge\'s reputation as the heaviest, sharpest, smartest and hardest working band of their new generation. And the most precious asset of the band – THE FANS are ready to bang their fucking head against the stage until it bleeds and sing along with the crowd-rousing chorus lines of POWERSURGE!

Creativity and passion create their own fusions and people just smack the older things away as soon as a newer breathe is brought into…! “Many” rock the parties and “more than many” just believe in living those tumultive instants. Yes, music believes in making people live and the composers are the angel-guards of this duty!!! But what of those who compose a finer tune on something already well-noted? That’s a tougher task but the world, as we all know, is never content and we always want more – hence an effort more to reproduce it in a different style, an experiment to represent it in a different imagination…\r\n\r\nWelcome to the world of DJs and shake hands with the “maître de ce monde” – master of this world - DJ Tejas!!! \r\n\r\nA self-made success icon frequently embossed on “Page 3” of various newspapers, DJ Tejas is a charming music-magician with a very absorbing history of how he came to be a DJ : \r\nto begin with, he started playing with editing-softwares. As he got amused with these empirical ventures, he initially developped about 50 numbers and started distributing them in private parties. Then his thirst engraved and he took this domaine more seriously. He brought home some music production softwares and later started learning by himself and practising through renting equipements from other DJs. This lasted for about an year while he mastered his hand on many different skills. He pitched in with college functions such as fashion shows and fresher’s parties which made him popular tout de suite! Then began the real journey where he followed a 6 months’ formation in Delhi and succeeded in making 10 of the most played DJ titles in India… once on road, his “sawari” doesn’t break… and it’s the same way in his parties where we just don’t stop banging.\r\n\r\nDJ Tejas is a music-machine: you name it and he produces it out of his “potali DJki” – bollywood, pop, house, psy-chill, lounge, asian underground and what not… His music becomes food for both heart and soul. Lights, sound, drinks, high hills and short robes, expensive perfumes and lavish voitures with chauffeur, big brands, beach or desert, underground or terrace, cool winter or rainy bonanza, he throws his parties into an extravaganza that never could be attained by anyone else. This unique style makes him a singular player of his sort and his fame flies across the globe:\r\nBBC Online Radio ranked his number in Friction’s “Electro East” lising for several days.\r\nGeneration Radio Heuston (USA) and Ethnotechno 24 hours online radio play his number which grow more and more popular everyday.\r\nHis masterpieces are always boomed “once more” in the popular clubs of the UK, the USA, Dubai and India.\r\nHe has charmed every throbing spot in India\'s best night clubs \r\n\r\n\r\nAll this at such tender an age is due to the dynamism that he carries and hardwork that he practises. Very professional in his work, he takes care of even a minute job with equal attention. His fans hence call him a perfect arm of music where no defaults have space. Girls cry ‘Oh! My! Gaush!’ and guys salute to this ‘cool dude’ who’s on the eminent list of Ahmedabad’s “personalités branchées” and a prominent name in Indian club milieu.\r\n\r\nDJ Tejas has, on many occasion, accompanied some of the grand names and the most achieving DJs of India such as RDB,  DJ Aqeel ,Akbar Sami, DJ Nyk, DJ Suketu, DJ Whosean , , DJ Rink,  and others.

To the uninitiated, Advaita is an eclectic fusion band based in New Delhi, India. It is the expression of eight distinct musical sensibilities that dissolve into each other to bring forth a truly unique and ingenious sound. \r\n\r\nIndian Classical Traditions are given new dimension, as they are reinvented within a contemporary soundscape in harmony with Rock and Electronica. Their music is deeply inspired by the quest to discover rhythms and textures that resonate around us and within us. The Sarangi, Tabla, Bass, Keyboards, Guitars and Drums blend seamlessly, complimented perfectly by two of the most gifted Hindustani and Western Vocalists. Their brand of contemporary ‘organic’ fusion has been lauded as one of the most original and ground- breaking sounds to ever come out of the Indian underground music scene. They have successfully carved out a niche` for their New Age Music in the Global context, while staying true to their characteristically Indian roots. \r\n\r\nThe “Advaita Experience” is defined by the pursuit of that incredible moment during performance when the musician becomes the music and forgets his own identity, resulting in thoroughly electrifying stage performances. \r\n\r\nSince their inception in 2004, Advaita has been established as one of the most thrilling, innovative and original acts on the Indian music scene, with the unique reputation of enthralling audiences in any kind of setting – from corporate events and Classical festivals to pub gigs and college shows. Hailed by music lovers and media alike, the band is now a well respected entity on the cultural map of Delhi.\r\n\r\nIn January 2006, some members of the band played on stage with international superstar Talvin Singh. Later that year, Advaita received a lot of praise and attention as the in house band featured weekly on NDTV’s talk show Face the Music with Vir Sanghvi. In November 2007 they inaugurated the ‘SAARC Bands Festival’, featuring the best bands from all the SAARC countries. Advaita’s diverse repertoire boasts of performances at numerous high profile corporate events for clients like The Taj Group, Vodafone, The Times of India and HCL amongst others. Appreciation from the classical community resulted in their presence at the Gwalior Heritage Festival (where they performed just before Ustaad Amjad Ali Khan on the same stage) and at the Prachisudha Festival organised by famous dancers Raja Radha Reddy.\r\n\r\nAdvaita was one of only four bands from India selected by famous producer John Leckie (who has worked with the likes of Pink Floyd, George Harrison and Radiohead) to record two songs with him for a compilation released by the British council. As part of this project, called the India Soundpad Project, the band recently toured the UK playing 6 shows in 5 cities, including the famous Great Escape Festival in Brighton. \r\n\r\nIn March 2009 Advaita launched its first album on EMI records titled Grounded in Space which further catapulted the status of the band. Recorded at the famed Yash Raj Studios, Mumbai, the album spent 4 weeks at number one on the International charts at the Music World stores for all of Delhi.  \r\n\r\nThe much awaited second album, \"The Silent Sea\" was released by EMI in February 2012!

It gave me inspiration to do my own thing.\"\r\n\r\nAfter doing the usual business of playing local shows, the trio set out the following year on a regional tour. One of the first gigs of the trip took them to a bar in Akron, where Black Keys\' drummer Patrick Carney just happened to be one of only a handful of people in the audience. This chance encounter led Wennerstrom and the Heartless Bastards to Fat Possum Records, with whom they released their debut, Stairs and Elevators, in early 2005.\r\n\r\nThe band moved on with critical praise in their back pocket, including a four-and-a-half star review from Rolling Stone, which took note that, when Wennerstrom “opens her throat on Stairs and Elevators … she sounds like she’s wailing on the shoulders of giants; her sad and angry vocals channeling all the swagger and spit of a young Robert Plant”\r\n\r\nBy whatever yardstick you care to measure, it was high time for Erika to get out of Dayton.\r\n\r\nIn true ascetic discipline, she moved to Austin, Texas in 2007 for a change of inspirational scenery and a new recording project. With the help of producer Mike McCarthy (Spoon, Trail of Dead), she assembled a group of musicians with whom she gave the songs life and uncovered yet another layer of Wennerstrom and the Heartless Bastards. Two of the new Bastards aren’t Texas ringers, but fellow Dayton brethren Dave Colvin on drums, and Jesse Ebaugh on bass, who actually played on the original demo that hooked Fat Possum, throw in one Austin native on guitar, Mark Nathan and you’ve got a new unstoppable force that “Take the stage and literally knock everybody down” – NY Times review of the Bastards SxSW record release performance.\r\n\r\nThe Decemberists’ guitarist Chris Funk said, \"It\'s been a few years since I\'ve had a voice on repeat in my mind. This voice seems to arrive in my ears while sound checking, often before the shows on a pre-show play list and after shows too -- the songs are just perfect and the band has found their spots behind this incredible woman. A unique and enduring artist arrived into our world once again.\"\r\n\r\nThe album, entitled The Mountain, (released February 2009) delivers the powerful howl that fans expect from the Heartless Bastards, but also weaves in adventure with mandolins, banjos, strings and Erika’s transcendent voice.','Ken Weinstein/Big Hassle','http://www.facebook.com/heartlessbastards/info','http://www.theheartlessbastards.com','http://soundcloud.com/heartlessbastards\n','','0','19971',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','heartless-bastards'),(86,0,2,2,'Anil Kant','','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Anil-Kant/18098593183?sk=info','http://www.anilkant.org','http://soundcloud.com/anil-kant','','0','19951',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','anil-kant'),(87,0,1,1,'joelene','Joelene Dove is a songwriter/ composer/ singer based in Delhi. She has released a few singles online as is already pretty famous through her youtube channel.\r\nJoelene started her journey in the field of music as a vocalist in about Yr 2000 (other than performing in college fests b4 that) with some of the best Delhi based English rock bands. Soon, she was on her own……as a solo performer, receiving a roaring audience all over India. By this time, Joelene also had a degree in Vocals and Piano from Trinity College, London, besides having a working knowledge of guitar and drums too!! She also learnt Indian Classical for 4 years…..and thus gained the rare quality of being able to do justice to both Engllish and Hindi music, falling into any genre from soft pop to hard rock!!!\r\n\r\nJoelene\'s USP is her unique voice and range, and also her soulful lyrics  which are, more often than not, a mix of Hindi and Urdu.

The idea or feeling taking birth in one band member’s mind is developed and brought to fruition by collective deliberation or Qayaas by the whole band. Five different people, their different moods, outlooks and music philosophies harmoniously blend to form compositions that reflect the true spirit and creative energy of our band; unadulterated in this wondrous journey by commercial concerns or other shortcuts.\r\n\r\nOur music tends to explore emotions, specific moments, certain relationships and particular events which resonate powerfully as we try to understand ourselves and the world around us. We do not aim to have a large body of musical compositions but only put through quality pieces governed by unique ideas and techniques. Each melody is a different journey, starting with something personal and then refining it to create a certain mood. As a whole, Qayaas is an accumulation of musicians from quite diverse backgrounds. All members have been, and still are, part of various other projects that serve as a vent for musical expression.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Qayaas originated after guitarist Khurram Waqar saw Umair jam with his previous band in his studio and invited him to work on material that he had written. What started out initially as an acoustic EP turned into a full blown album. When Fifu and Sherry who were already in a band ‘kNuMB’ with Khurram joined in, “Qayaas” was born. Sarmad Ghafoor who was an old friend of Fifu and Khurram joined in later when he was invited by them to come and listen to the album. He loved the material and became a part of Qayaas. Khurram and Sarmad then worked together to complete the audio production of the album which was released on April 16, 2011 in Pakistan in Peshawar, Islamabad, Lahore, Sialkot and Karachi. The album can also be bought online on CDBaby, iTunes, Amazon and Napster.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing about the album is that it has been recorded and produced completely by the band. This is at par with any international recording with attention being paid to ever minute little detail. Every single song has been mixed and mastered as per the overall feel and vibe of the song. \r\n\r\nWe have recently won the JD Award for the best rock band from Pakistan 2010. The awards were hosted by Jack Daniels and Rolling Stones Magazine,India. We performed in New Delhi at The Hard Rock Cafe on December 16, 2010 for the JD Rock Awards Tour in front of a packed 800 crowd.\r\n\r\nWe are the first band from Pakistan to be invited to come and perform at one of the biggest and most prestigious  Music Festivals in USA called SXSW (South By Southwest) which takes place every year in Austin, Texas.\r\n\r\nOur song “Inquilaab” recently made it to the Semi Finals of International Songwriting Competition (ISC) out of 15,000 entries from all over the globe.\r\n\r\nWe were the most played band with our song “Mera Wana“ on the METAL ASIA COMPILATION 2010 which included all Asian metal bands.\r\n\r\nOur songs “Inquilaab” and “Pal” have been chosen as the soundtrack for an upcoming movie “Waar”. The movie is being produced my Mindworks Media.\r\n\r\nOur song “Mera Wana” will be used in the soundtrack of another upcoming movie “Peochar” by Mindworks Media.\r\n\r\nWe have so far released 4 music videos “Tanha”, \"Pukaar\", \"Umeed\" and \"Shehrezade\" which are currently doing the rounds on the Pakistan music channels namely MTV, Aag, ARY Musik, Oxygene and Play TV.  We are in the process of releasing more singles and videos.\r\n\r\nQayaas is based in Islamabad, Pakistan and consists of:\r\n\r\nUmair Jaswal: Lead Vocals.\r\nKhurram Waqar:Guitars, Arrangement & Audio Production.\r\nSarmad Abdul Ghafoor: Guitars & Audio Production.\r\nShaheryar Ghayas: Bass Guitar.\r\nSalman Rafique: Drums/Percussions.\r\n\r\nUmair Jaswal is the youngest of the lot, at the age of 24 and is a unique vocal talent. He shares mature musical ideas with the rest of the band. Famous for his stage presence and covers of Guns N’ Roses with his other band ‘SilverSmoke’, he is a student of geophysics but still very determined to do music professionally.\r\n\r\n\r\nKhurram Waqar (a.k.a. kW) is a multi talented musician with guitars being his main forte. He has been playing the instrument for the last 18 years and has been a part of various bands from the 90’s (‘Fantazia’, ‘Entity’) to the current year(‘kNuMB’, ‘Qayaas’). He not only recorded a whole instrumental album with his band ‘Cocytus’ in USA while doing his Masters but also performed regularly in the Pittsburgh circuit. After returning to Pakistan in 2003, he formed a progressive rock band ‘kNuMB’ (www.knumb.com) who are known for their live performances across Pakistan and are the only band in the country to play a unique mix of songs and guitar instrumentals. He has been a part of two G3 inspired guitar instrumental concerts featuring the prominent guitarists of Pakistan and has just finished writing material for the new instrumental album. He was instrumental in the formation of ‘Qayaas’  in the summer of 2008 to fulfill his desire to make Urdu songs in the alternative (grunge) and progressive domain and they have just finished recoding their album. He also has a passion for audio production and has his own state of the art studio set up (Rootgate Studios) in Islamabad where the 70 % of ‘Qayaas’ and all of ‘kNuMB’ albums have been tracked. Having built his repertoire as a technical guitar player with solid theoretical knowhow, he is also a respected guitar teacher in Islamabad. He works from home as a Senior Project Manager for an IT company based in USA.\r\n\r\nSarmad Abdul Ghafoor (a.k.a Sarmad) started off with his passion for producing music 18 years ago. An accomplished guitar player and a regular session player for Atif Aslam, he has been a part of various rock bands in the country for the last decade namely being the lead guitar player and producer for the band ‘Rungg’.  In 2008, he became a full time member of ‘Qayaas’. He showcases his artistry as multi-talented composer, guitarist and music producer. He has not only produced Atif Aslam’s 2 solo multi platinum albums but has also continuously produced music for various rock bands in the country. He works as a full time musician in Islamabad.\r\n\r\nShaheryar Ghayas (a.k.a Sherry) is a solid musician playing in 3 bands at the moment. He is playing bass with Islamabad based Metal band ‘Surge’ for the last 5 years. With Grunge and Progressive Rock as part of his pulse, he has also been playing rhythms for a progressive/instrumental rock band ‘kNuMB’ for the last 6 years. Still weaving intricate melodies with the band, he’s now a part of ‘Qayaas’ where he again assumes the role as a bass player. He works as a Creative Manager in an Advertising Agency in Islamabad.\r\n\r\nSalman Rafique (a.k.a. Fifu) has been playing guitars for the last 18 years, and drums for the last 8. With influences ranging from Rush to Pantera, Fifu has been a prominent part of the local underground circuit; contributing as the guitar hand or the drum hog for many bands, studio and live. He is known for his famous drum solos during concerts and is a technician when it comes to execution and music theory. Fifu has many bands to his credit, ‘Surge’, ‘kNuMB’ and now ‘Qayaas’. He is a Software Product Manager in an IT Startup based in Islamabad.\r\n\r\nWe realize that the while on the surface the situation in the country threatens art disruption, it is also breeding ground for rebellion. Historically, some of the most poignant criticism of war and violence has come from rock musicians and songwriters providing an outlet for the sentiments of public at large. The cathartic quality of rock music that has given voice to the anguish and torment of generations finds a most fitting context in our country. Music can be used as a motivation for the advocacy of a common cause. Our singles “Umeed”, “Tanha” and “Inquilab” do exactly that. They utilize the ability of music as a potent medium of communication and a form of political activism. We feel that music can go a long way in healing the heartache of our war torn nation and emphasize the importance of unity and keeping a positive outlook in times of struggle (Umeed meaning hope), Anguish (Tanha meaning alone) and the way forward (Inquilab meaning revolution).','Eva Dowd eva@evadowd.com','http://www.facebook.com/QAYAAS/info','http://www.qayaas.com','','http://www.reverbnation.com/qayaas','0','19715',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','qayaas'),(89,0,16,16,'Jatt te Jattiyan','Ki Sifat KaRaaN mAin JaTTiYaaN DI,\r\nSau DisdIYa eHNa \r\nMaJaJaaN PaTTiYaaN Di,\r\nFacebook Te v EHna aA k PaTT LayE JaTT Ne, \r\nLaGdiyaaN \r\nNe ShareeF PaR nA kIsE NaLoN gHaT Ne,\r\n\r\nJaTTA nE v YaaRo Ure LAyiAa nE RAuNKaaN,\r\nuDeeK diYaaN nE jAtTIYa IK wAari \r\nsAde WaLL nu Aun khAA,\r\njAtt Ne PunjAbI aWE jAni khAni mAgAr jAnDE \r\nnAhi.\r\nJaTtIYa Di V HaWA khArAaB KehNDiyA aSi Vi ThoNu ChaHaNDe nAhi,\r\n\r\nEthE kaRo yAaRo fUN sHUn,\r\nNet te La ke Na KIsE Ne YaaRIYaaN \r\nKhaTTiYaaN,\r\nAaP V join KaRo Te hora Nu V krWaaO \r\nPage aPna \"JaTT Te \r\nJaTTiYaaN','','http://www.facebook.com/JattRulz','http://www.facebook.com/JattRulz','','','0','19609',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','jatt-te-jattiyan'),(90,0,2,2,'Dj Angel','\"DJ Angel \"(Dj-Remixer)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Booking Contact JASON :- +919007082193\r\nFor Booking Mail @ admin@kreativekrew.com\r\n\r\n Twitter :- deejayangell\r\nSoundcloud :- http://soundcloud.com/dj-angel007\r\n\r\nDownload Link :- http://www.soundipod.com/index.php?view=display&id=4380&option=com_music\r\n\r\nYoutube Link :- http://www.youtube.com/user/aanaljohal?feature=mhee\r\n','jason:- +919007082193','http://www.facebook.com/djangel.india/info','http://www.djangel.in','http://soundcloud.com/dj-angel007','','0','19440',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','dj-angel'),(92,0,2,4,'Ajay Atul','Fanpage of legendary composers AJAY-ATUL, The only place on web where you\'ll get all the pics, videos,Songs and updates about AJAY-ATUL.\r\nJoin our Fans Club for more interactions.\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/ajayatulfans/','','http://www.facebook.com/AjayAtulOnline/info?ref=ts','http://www.ajayatul.com','http://soundcloud.com/ajayatulfans','','0','19124',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','ajay-atul'),(93,0,0,0,'BUGO','1996-2000 PANE PENE PAN\r\n2000 LA PRIMA GRATTA\r\n2001 SENTIMENTO WESTERNATO\r\n2002 DAL LOFAI AL CISEI\r\n2004 GOLIA & MELCHIORRE\r\n2006 SGUARDO CONTEMPORANEO\r\n2008 CONTATTI\r\n2011 NUOVI RIMEDI PER LA MIOPIA','','http://www.facebook.com/bugosound/info','http://www.nuovirimediperlamiopia.com','http://soundcloud.com/bugoforever','','0','18956',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','bugo'),(94,2,1,1,'Jalebee Cartel','Jalebee Cartel has challenged the notion that dance music is a Western domain by single-handedly putting India on the international EDM map. Composed of four members, Arjun Vagale (Groove & Mixing), Ash Roy (Vocals & Percussions), Ashvin Mani Sharma (Synths & FX) and G-force Arjun (Bass Guitar), Jalebee has been taking India by storm for over five years. From individual DJ sets to live gigs, producing to composing, the multi-talented group does it all. \r\n\r\nThe live act features Jalebee’s own compositions, which are broken up, twisted and served fresh with ethnic sounds thrown in for good measure. It’s a funky, international sound that’s unlikely to be recognized as Indian. The live element creates an extra edge that is constantly evolving, a potent, energetic livewire of influences from house to techno, overlaid with live vocals, percussions, drums and tablas. Jalebee’s sound isn’t about neat packaging: it’s about fusing genres to create a raw, electric style of urban dance music. \r\n\r\n2010 has been Jalebee’s most massive year yet. The group has performed at the hottest clubs and biggest festivals across India and abroad, including Fusion Festival (Germany), Tresor Berlin (Germany), Smirnoff Experience Festival (Mumbai), Lille 3000 (France), The Big Chill Festival (Goa), SunBurn Festival (Goa), Perrier Chill Out Festival (Dubai), C/O Pop Festival (Germany), Paradiso (Netherlands), Juicy Beats Festival (Germany), Chi Club (Dubai), in addition to gigs in the US, Canada, Sweden, Indonesia and Korea. They clocked over 120 performances in 2009 alone. \r\n\r\nJalebee has hit dance charts worldwide, with their track “Apartment 88” hitting No.1 on Pete Tong’s Bedroom Bedlam Chart, “Destiny” voted Best Sunset Soundtrack on BBC and numerous Beatport hits, with \"Funkin A” (Aki Bergan Remix) peaking at No.4 on the Deep House Charts. The group has numerous releases, previous and forthcoming, on labels like Ostwind Records (DE), Neurotraxx Deluxe (IT), Vapour Recordings (AU), eVapour8 (AU), Save Room Records (DE), Baroque Records (UK), Mashtronic (EU), Frequenza (IT), ALiVE Recordings (UK), BEEF Records (CH) and System Records (US), to name but a few. \r\n\r\nRadio shows from Argentina to Europe to Indonesia feature Jalebee tracks on stations like BBC Radio, Proton Radio, Pulse Radio, Virus (CH), DI FM and Dance Radio GR. With two monthly shows, “Deep Fried Jalebee” on Frisky Radio and “Twisted Sweet” on Dance Radio (Greece), Jalebee brings in over 3,000 monthly listeners. The group has been featured in Rolling Stone (India), MixMag (UK) and DJ Mag, and featured in Elle (India) magazine’s ‘Hot 100 People, 2007.’ They’ve seen phenomenal support from A-list DJs like Pete Tong, Richie Hawtin, Josh Wink, Laurent Garnier, Dubfire, Sharam, Nick Warren, Moshic, Kasey Taylor, Hernan Cattaneo, Dave Seaman, Nic Fanciulli, Jimpster, Tom Budden, Anil Chawla—and even Apl De Ap from Black Eyed Peas. \r\n\r\nIf being the first artists in India to release an album on USB memory sticks and streaming their gigs live on the Internet wasn’t enough, their music video for the track “Tough Cookie” hit the charts on VH1 with full force, and their first full-length artist album titled ONEPOINTNOTHING debuted in 2009. The album and music video were both critically acclaimed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','dev@unmute.in // +91 99993 69935','http://www.facebook.com/jalebeecartel/info','http://www.jalebee.in','http://soundcloud.com/indianelectronica/destiny-jalebee-cartel','','0','18873',0,NULL,1,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-10-09 13:02:54',257,'[\" info@jalebee.in\\r\",\"\\r\",\"dev@unmute.in\\r\",\"\\r\",\"maktubmuzik@gmail.com\"]','[\" +91 99993 69935\"]','jalebee-cartel'),(95,0,45,45,'Concord Dawn','Concord Dawn (aka Evan Short & Matt Harvey) burst onto the New Zealand music scene back in mid 1999 with their unique high octane Drum and Bass sound.

Both Concord Dawn and Disturbance sold far better than expected and the boys received strong reviews in all forms of media not only for their releases but also for their energetic live performances. For the next year they went into hiatus to refine the Concord Dawn sound further with Evan heading to London for 5 months to immerse himself in the culture of the Drum and Bass homeland. Upon his return to New Zealand work was started on their 3rd album Uprising with tracks like “Morning Light” and “Don’t Tell Me” finding international acclaim well before the album’s release. Uprising was released in New Zealand in September 2003 and reached gold sales status in an amazing 3 months.\r\n\r\nWith Concord Dawn now well established internationally and their catalogue now being distributed worldwide Evan and Matt embarked on a seemingly never ending world tour, travelling all over the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and Australia. At the 2003 bNet music awards “Morning Light” won \"Best Song\" and \"Most Radio Play\" and at the 2004 bNet music awards Uprising received \"Best Album\" and \"Best Electronic Release\". Concord Dawn were also nominated for \"Best Electronic Act\" at the 2004 New Zealand music awards but narrowly missed out to Salmonella Dub.\r\n\r\nWork on their long awaited 4th album was completed in early 2005 and was titled Chaos By Design to express the album’s musically eclectic nature. The album and singles won critical acclaim worldwide with various tracks off the albums being signed to some of the biggest and most respected Drum and Bass labels worldwide such as Metalheadz, Ram Records and Hospital Recordings. Chaos By Design also won “Best Electronic Album” at the 2006 New Zealand Music Awards.\r\n\r\nAnother full world tour was embarked on shortly after the release with Matt relocating to Vienna, in the heart of Europe and Evan covering New Zealand, Australia, Asia and the Americas from home base in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n2008 saw increased demand for Concord Dawn all over the globe, with an ever increasing DJ schedule. In August 2008 we will have the release of \"Twilight\", a mix cd featuring new Concord Dawn tunes as well as Uprising recording artists and more, and a full national tour of NZ that encompasses 15 dates !! \r\n\r\nIn 2010 the first solo Concord Dawn record \"The Enemy Within\" was released, with guests and collaborations including Thomas Oliver, Rido, JDubs, Nina McSweeney and Paul McLaney. \r\n\r\nFollowing this was 2011s \"The Race To Zero\" EP as well as collaborations with Trei, Jade and State of Mind set be released in the second half of 2011.\r\n\r\n2012 - Wipeout - Trei and Concord Dawn EP\r\n2011 - The Race To Zero EP\r\n2010 - The Enemy Within LP\r\n2006 - Chaos By Design LP\r\n2003 - Uprising LP\r\n2001 - Disturbance LP\r\n2000 - Concord Dawn LP\r\n\r\n','info@concord-dawn.co.nz','http://www.facebook.com/concorddawnNZ/info','','http://soundcloud.com/concord-dawn','','0','18789',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','concord-dawn'),(96,0,2,2,'BREAK UP KE BAAD - MARATHI SONG',' Samir was preparing Music for a college level competition.

And that very show kick started his journey, then performed another show with Kral at Hotel Abakash, Met Sumon from Aurthohin at a particular concert, and then went on to visit Sumon\'s place, in addition, Sumon was also friends with his cousin Aldnane.\r\n\r\nDuring that time Aurthohin was in need of a vocalist and was opening up auditions for one, but since Rafa was already serving as the vocalist for Kral, he wasn\'t asked by Sumon to hop in, but later on, Imtiaz joined Kral. And so, he was later recruited by Aurthohin as their new vocalist. Later Sumon found out that he can also play the guitars, so he served as both their guitarist and vocalist.\r\n\r\nHe had been learning Nazrul songs during his childhood, as well as did some impromptu tabla playing, but it really did not help him utilize his skills on it as he did not practice the instrument at all, ironically he loathed music, sometime before the year 2000 he was taught to play some guitar chords by his elder brother. so he started plucking some random strings helter-skelter, and this randomisation of string plucking along the way, lead him to learn the instrument to a moderately \"sound\" level.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he was taken to a concert by his brother and all of a sudden he became interested in drums ever since that show, he immediately left playing the guitars and switched to drums. managed to cover up three Dream Theater albums in a period of three months.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he was practicing playing the bass, and there was one keyboard lying in his house as well, so after experimenting with a few keys here and there, he got to learn playing that as well. After joining Aurthohin and launching an album, such obsessions of him with practicing and experimenting with various music instruments started to decrease.\r\n\r\nHe used to compose and create his own songs but didn\'t know how to record them. So he took a software from Sumon in order to experiment on how to record songs in his computer efficiently and clearly, and since his brother used to make his own songs and recorded them, he started taking interest in his works.\r\n\r\nAnd as usual, like a quintessential nerd, he used to read any and every book he could come across regarding this field of work on which he was currently engaged in, then experimented on modifying/remixing a few songs, and through the course of time he has learned how to master this technique and here is where he stands: A prolific music producer, providing musical scores for various TV commercials, was involved in the production of Powersurge\'s debut album as well, as well as being an active participant in the mixing and composition of the development of Aurthohin\'s album. \"Kadbe Bishshoy,\" \"Nikrishshtho,\" and \"Anmone\" were songs composed and tuned by him. As well as he played an active and major role in the mixing and production of albums of various bands. As well as working on his own solo album, and also working on the production of various solo artists.\r\n\r\nHe has worked on all kinds of Genre.\r\n\r\nHe plays drums for Severe Dementia; a death metal band.\r\n\r\nDrummer and Vocal for Kral, a progressive metal band.\r\n\r\nDrummer and Vocal for Aurthohin.\r\n\r\nAnd lead guitar and vocal for his own band \'The Joint Family\',     \r\nAmbient Progressive Rock. \r\n\r\nHe worked with various genres over the years, prefer doing his own solo album as a soft rock project.

I often find myself moving quickly between a live set with my band to composing strings for a film to DJing a dirty dance set to writing an acoustic song within a short period of time. My sound comes from finding inspiration from those moments in between all of that madness.”\r\nCinema is Karsh\'s most ambitious album to date. Despite the myriad of influences pulsating through him during the two years it took to produce Cinema, many of the compositions were written on an acoustic guitar or piano – often while Karsh was either on the road, or in a studio. But as the title “Cinema” suggests, the process of scoring films has had as much impact on this album’s sound as Kale\'s usual palette of progressive electro-rock and fusion influences. “Cinema” is the aggregate of these diverse inspirations, experiences and musical expressions within one cohesive vision.\r\nThe album begins with the enigmatic Island. The track retains both a retro and progressive feel borrowing from both nu-school electronica and an 80\'s new wave guitar sound. The track features Kale on vocoded vocals and acoustic guitar as well as master flautist Pandit Ajay Prasanna on what sounds like an instrument straight out of a Frank Zappa composition. This track was inspired and born out of the film scoring sessions of Ashes (a film directed by and starring accomplished actor Ajay Naidu).\"\r\nOther tracks like Supernova, Man On Fire and the title track Cinema, though disparate in their stylistic approaches, were also created and inspired by some of Kale\'s film related world. Supernova - created while Karsh and his long time collaborators “the Midival Punditz” undertook the commissioned rescoring of the 1973 Bruce Lee classic, “Enter the Dragon” - brings together an urgent santoor line with Kale\'s signature electric tabla sound, driven by a powerful breaks groove and glitched out production that could only be inspired by Bruce Lee himself. Man On Fire is an ambient wash of blissfully distorted sitar performed by Pandit Sunil Das and keyboards performed by Kale and plays like an oasis from the otherwise loud and sometimes aggressive sound on the record, and is inspired by sounds of cremation of a human being on the banks of the Ganges.\r\nThe title track Cinema starts off with ambient guitars and bansuri flute almost as if to start a calm peaceful journey, only to then be taken into a different world all together. Prog-rock guitars collide with orchestral strings as a psychedelic odd time electro rhythm creates a bed for the serene classical vocals of Vidhi Sharma.\r\nKarsh Kale honed his talents as a songwriter and penned songs with Sting, Norah Jones, Anne Rani, Ed Kowalczyk and the Midival Punditz. (Kale co-wrote and co-produced much of the Midival Punditz release Hello Hello in 2009). Writing on an acoustic guitar forced Karsh to start “writing songs based on changes and chord structure rather than modes and raags (Indian scales)” Avalanche is such a track - a dark cautionary tale that starts in what feels like an organic forest of piano, acoustic guitar and percussion only to then get uprooted into the modernity of flowing breaks and cinematic strings. The song features the earthy vocals of long time Kale collaborator Shahid Siddiqui.\r\nAnother stand out collaboration comes in the form of Mallika Jam, which features the vocal stylings of Danish Pop sensation Anne Rani. The track quickly moves from dubstep inspired percussion and heavy Zeppelin style guitar riffs to a serene acoustic landscape where raag and pop vocals intermingle.	The track also features sarod master Pandit Mukesh Sharma. Peekaboo, a dark ballad featuring the eerily sexy vocals of Monica Dogra (aka “Shaair” from India’s critically acclaimed independent band “Shaair n Func” and the costar of the hit independent Bollywood film Dhobi Ghat). Peekaboo tackles the subject of obsession and stalking. The lyrics where penned by Kale and Tapan Raj (one half of the Indian electronica supergroup The Midival Punditz”) who also added production on the track.\r\nKarsh’s wide palette of musical inspiration manifests itself in his collaboration with the lead singer of indie-rock darling, Todd Michaelsen of My Pet Dragon on the track Phoenix Rising. The track evolves into a larger than life sound pinning power chords against drum and bass beats and growling synth bass lines.\r\nFor fans of early Karsh Kale albums Realize and Liberation, Karsh does not disappoint as tracks like Sunbeam, Ma and Absence retain that old school Karsh Kale quality; merging classical Indian forms like Ghazal, Hindustani and film music with Kale\'s electro-rock inspired aesthetic.	Guest artists Vishal Vaid, Papon and Shruti Pathak bring a fresh and nuanced approach to traditional Indian vocals. Each is a master in their own right but is framed to maximum effect by Karsh\'s production, arrangement and composition skills.\r\nTwo songs featured on Cinema were inspired and created days after returning from the annual Burning Man festival – a seven day experimental artistic gathering in the desolate and extreme Black Rock Desert of Nevada with over 50,000 people experiencing some of the finest electronica musicians and visual artists from around the world. \"I was super inspired and full of music after returning from a challenging yet moving experience at Burning Man. I wrote Joy as an ode to the sunrise set...and Sandstorm as an ode to harsh nights. For those who have been there, I think these sounds will ring true....but they are not really finished till I get to drop them on the Playa\"\r\nThe sonic landscape of Cinema was created with Karsh’s tried and true team of collaborators: Gaurav Raina of the Midival Punditz co produced the album while Indian film composer Salim Merchant also makes an appearance - this time as a co writer on Ma which also features a vocal hook sung by Kale\'s daughter Milan Xai. Kale also employed good friend and master producer Lasse \"Illinton\" Jensen for the final mixes. An album inspired by his film-related musical endeavors required a strong visual statement to compliment the music on Cinema.	As such, Karsh collaborated with award winning visual artist Archan Nair from New Delhi to give the album a strong visual statement.\r\nWith Cinema, it is clear that Karsh\'s sources of inspiration have expanded – from Indian classical, to electronica, to rock and now to music for film. Challenging himself to write songs with an ear for Western modalities, Karsh further pushes if not blurs the boundaries of rock, world and electronic music.\r\nContact\r\n\r\nGENERAL INFO\r\ninfo@karshkale.com\r\nBOOKINGS\r\nbookings@karshkale.com\r\nPRESS\r\nIndia: neysa.mendes@gmail.com\r\nU.S. and Int’l: ryan@pressjunkiepr.com\r\n\r\n### Six Degrees Records:\r\nJeremy Valencia t: 415-626-6334 ext. 24 jeremy@sixdegreesrecords.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Press Junkie PR: Ryan Romana t: 415-385-1784 ryan@pressjunkiepr.com INDIA P.R /PRESS  Neysa Mendes +91 9821336963 neysa.mendes@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/karshkalemusic','','','','53932630567','15810',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-10-06 01:11:07',0,'[\"\"]','[\"\"]','karsh-kale'),(112,0,2,2,'Kaushal S.

Her songs are honest and very strong. \r\nHer vocal abilities are showcased really well, as is her guitar work, and harp playing. Sandi’s a well-rounded musician and she made a great record. It was a joy to work with her.”\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Kevin Shirley (Led Zeppelin, John Hiatt, Journey) also mixed two tracks, ‘When The Sun Comes Crashing Down’ and \'Big Ones Get Away\'. “Her writing is fantastic,” says Shirley, “and her singing is wonderful on two great songs. ‘When The Sun Comes Crashing Down’ has everything it needs to be a hit!”\r\n\r\nThen there is the intriguingly titled ‘I Love You Like A Lunatic’, based on her “life-changing” love affair with superstar blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa. The couple have been together three years now, living and loving on and off the road. Like a modern-day Johnny Cash and June Carter story, “my life just turned crazy,” says Sandi. “Yet that’s what everybody wants, that insane kind of love that utterly consumes you.”\r\n\r\nLike David Bowie and Elton John, who also enjoyed early one-off hits before finding their true niche as musical artists, Sandi feels that Flesh and Blood is her coming of age album. “All I ever want to do is write songs that connect with people. And with this album I’ve finally found a place where I can make the very best music I can achieve. The people that only know me from ‘Punk Rocker’ won’t recognise me on this album. But they are going to find out.”\r\n\r\nSandi Thom is not who you think she is.

Wandering across the world and bathed in various artistic scenes, he was provided with a constant creative drive. He started playing guitar when he was nine years old, and having been reared in a rock’n’roll and funk atmosphere, he first concentrated on these musical styles. By his mid-teens, he had composed, produced and recorded over one hundred original songs. He performed with a number of live bands in different countries and continued to create music and release rock albums for another decade. During this time, he also picked up the family trade and started tattooing alongside his parents and older brother Filip Leu.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the nineties, his interest gradually shifted towards electronic music, causing him to explore new digital horizons. In 2002, AJJA and  musician friends Master Margherita, Dymons and Flooting Grooves created The Peaking Goddess Collective, a chill & psytrance band that fuses live instruments  and digital technology. After performing in many parties and festivals and releasing tracks on many compilations, their debut album “Organika” was released on Peak Records in August 2007.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2003, AJJA, in collaboration with his partner, visual artist Tanina Munchkina and musicians Dj Gaspard and Master Margherita, founded the psychedelic trance label Peak Records. In five years, the label has gained respect and a solid reputation in the psytrance scene, releasing many quality night-time and chill albums and compilations. \r\n\r\nThe same year saw the birth of Yab Yum, the fully digital project shared by AJJA and Dj Gaspard. They have since released numerous tracks on world-renowned labels, and their debut album “Nocturnal Emissions”, released on Peak Records in December 2006, has been widely praised in the international psytrance scene. They have performed with growing success worldwide from Japan to South America. After Dj Gaspard, left Yab Yum in June 2008, Ajja decided to continue the project by himself.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, AJJA started a solo project under his own name. This digital live-act is primarily 144bpm-based, focusing on groovy, non-cheesy, psychedelic trance that can be played in the morning or in the middle of the night.\r\n\r\nAJJA released his first solo night-time track in 2007, followed later the same year by his debut album “PSYCHOGENICA”, on the Irish label Syncronize Records. In 2008, AJJA had more releases on Peak Records, the Boom 2006 dvd, Syncronize, Northern Psylights, Gaian Mind, Phar Psyde, Liquid, Pixan with more new tracks to come. His second album is in the works and is planned for release on Peak Records in late 2009.\r\n\r\nIn the past three years, AJJA has performed in numerous parties and festivals including Boom, Universo Paralello, Full Moon, Antaris, Glade, Soulclipse, Life, Gaian Mind, Wickerman, World People, Forgotten Ritual and Waveform Project. His much appreciated live sets have already rocked & grooved dancefloors in Japan, The United States, Canada, Brazil, Russia, Switzerland, France, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Italy, England, Ireland, Scotland, Ukraine and Turkey. \r\n\r\nNot satisfied with so much activity, Ajja also composes music for theater plays, designs Peak Records covers with his partner Tanina Munchkina, designs web applications and works as a tattoo artist in his family’s shop in Lausanne, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nAn energetic, enthusiastic and gifted being, AJJA is an artist not to be missed!\r\n','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ajja/49408601989?sk=info','http://www.ajja.leufamilyiron.com','','','0','12602',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','ajja'),(123,0,22,22,'Roshan Prince','','','http://www.facebook.com/theroshanprince/info?ref=ts','','','','0','12510',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','roshan-prince'),(124,0,48,48,'RAETH','Raeth is an internationally acclaimed Pakistani Sufi-Rock band comprising Three youngsters.

At only 24, the duo already has a decade worth of creative experimenting behind them, from making politically incorrect rock music to writing absurd theatrical plays. However, it was only in 2010 that their musical passion culminated into the indie electro vibes of ‘Mumbai Science’, creating a sound that melts contemporary electro-synths with a vintage techno feel.\r\n\r\nBegin 2010, the duo signed with the notorious label Lektroluv Records, releasing four original EP’s (Woof EP, Ancova EP, Gold EP and Lotus EP). Club hits like ‘Ancova’, ‘Gold’ and ‘Lotus’ got picked up rapidly by artists around the globe (2 many dj’s, Crookers, Erol Alkan, Boys Noize, Tiga and beyond), putting Mumbai Science on the worlds EDM radar. Apart from their original work, Mumbai Science is building an impressive list of remixes. To date, the duo finished remixes for Mixhell (Boysnoize Records), Goose (!K7), Crookers (Southern Fried), Alex Gopher (Go 4 Music), Shameboy (East), Highbloo (Lektroluv) and Jaymo & Andy George (Moda Music). \r\n\r\nSo, what’s next for Mumbai Science? The duo plans to release not one, not two, but three (!!!) original EP’s in the coming months: “With this trilogy, I feel like we experimented with genres like New Beat, Future Techno, Acid and Electro...

BLAKC is a band from Mumbai made up of five very unique, talented individuals. They are (in no order of importance) Shawn Pereira, Shishir Thakur, Roop Thomas, Rein Dias and Anish Menon. Before we get to know them better, let’s see how BLAKC was first formed. \r\n\r\nIn early 2006, Shawn was a fun-loving college-going kid. His priorities in life were to attend as little college as possible while meeting as many women as possible. He decided the way to go was to be a rockstar. Enter Anish, another fun-loving, college-going kid. He wanted to be a high flying guy in the corporate world. So much so that he actually turned up for one of BLAKC’s gigs at a later time in a suit, and then left without playing. But he too wanted to be a rockstar. They made a lot more money and did a lot less to earn it. Anyway, Anish met Shawn and concluded that they might just have something in common. So they got together with Gaurav and Vishwanath (who then formed Red Cube after they left BLAKC) and Sylvester, Shawn’s guitarist-friend. They jammed for a week, entered into a competition under the supposedly temporary name of BLAKC and came third in a college competition and the name stuck. \r\n\r\nTowards the end of 2006, Gaurav and Nath were replaced by Roop and Shishir and BLAKC started composing its own music. In February 2007, Reinhardt replaced Sylvester and the lineup was complete. BLAKC went on to win a local college competition and that’s where it all began. \r\n\r\nIn the past three years that BLAKC has been around with its present lineup, they participated in a lot of local college competitions. After making it to the finals of both IRock and Campus Rock, they graduated to opening and headlining shows in Mumbai as well as other cities. Today BLAKC has played over eighty shows across 14 cities in India. \r\n\r\nBLAKC released their debut album \'Choking On  A Dream\' in December 2008. The album DID NOT sell out like crazy :) but the general consensus (fans and critics alike) is that BLAKC is definitely a band to watch out for. Lucky enough to sell around 700 cds. The band is currently writing new music for their second album and has no plans to allow life as such to disrupt the crazy life they are living. \r\n\r\n“BLAKC has always been about two things, the music and the people. We believe that our music is an extension of our personalities and the only way to connect to so many music lovers. Off stage we are weird; on stage we can tear a place apart purely because of the energy we have. BLAKC since its beginning has been unable to fit into genres, we stopped trying and stuck to doing what we loved doing more than any other which is making our own music. We each have such various influences that every song has multiple personalities. We love what we do and we love that you like us enough to have read this.

Com ele, a banda ganhou, em votação popular, concurso da TramaVirtual e foi ao Rio de Janeiro abrir show de Maria Rita. À viagem seguiram-se apresentações em São Paulo que renderam bons comentários e garantiram regresso à capital paulista, em 2008.\r\n\r\nO segredo do sucesso do grupo está no talento para compor canções que remetem a uma ancestralidade pop de assimilação imediata, ao mesmo tempo em que desafia ouvintes atentos a desvendar novas camadas sonoras e líricas a cada audição. Foi esse equilíbrio entre o popular e o experimental que rendeu ao Apanhador Só tanto reconhecimento, antes mesmo de seu primeiro álbum, Apanhador Só, ser lançado em 2010 e ir direto para as listas de melhores daquele ano.\r\n\r\nConsagrado pop\r\nCom o lançamento do primeiro disco cheio, choveram elogios nas principais publicações culturais brasileiras destacando a destreza dos gaúchos para renovar e lapidar o rock – fundindo referências do tango ao reggae com o charme da percussão sucateira e poesias bem escritas e bem cantadas. Tudo isso numa embalagem impecável: cada canção ganhou uma ilustração do cartunista Fabiano Gummo e caligrafia próprias no encarte do disco – inestimável presente para os que, em plena revolução digital, esgotaram a primeira tiragem da bolachinha nos concorridos shows de lançamento.\r\n\r\nO refinamento pop de seu debut colocou, definitivamente, o grupo na linha de frente da nova música brasileira, com direito a indicação na categoria Aposta MTV do Video Music Brasil (VMB) 2010 e consagração no Prêmio Açorianos de Música, de onde o Apanhador Só saiu laureado por “Melhor Álbum Pop”, “Melhor Produtor Musical” (Marcelo Fruet) e “Melhor Projeto Gráfico” (Rafael Rocha).\r\n\r\nTambém disponível gratuitamente em seu site, Apanhador Só atingiu a impressionante marca de mais de 50 mil downloads em um ano – número que duplicou nos meses seguintes e vem crescendo diariamente. Os números se convertem em coro durante os shows, em especial em “Um Rei e o Zé” – cujo clipe, uma adorável e divertida partida de taco-bola produzida com esmero pela Sofá Verde Filmes, é presença constante na programação da MTV e levou a banda a ser indicada ao VMB 2011, desta vez como Revelação.\r\n\r\nAonde o povo está\r\nO reconhecimento da crítica amparado por um séquito fiel de admiradores sustenta apresentações lotadas tanto em sua Porto Alegre natal quanto no cobiçado circuito do SESC São Paulo, em eventos disputados como Virada Cultural Paulista e Feira Música Brasil, e em festivais, casas de show e teatros das principais cidades brasileiras. A simpatia irresistível do frontman Alexandre Kumpinski, somada à guitarra esmerilhada de Felipe Zancanaro, ao baixo sedutor de Fernão Agra, à bateria precisa de Martin Estevez e à inefável bicicleta percussiva – símbolo da banda –, arrebata plateias por onde quer que passe.\r\n\r\nAinda colhendo os louros de sua bela estreia, o Apanhador Só decidiu, em 2011, reinventar seus recentes clássicos e trouxe a público um novo trabalho. Gravado na sala da casa de Kumpinski usando gaiola, sacos plásticos, ralador de queijo, cantil de escoteiro, talheres, pedaços de conduíte, tecladinhos, walkie-talkie e outras bugigangas, objetos eletrônicos e instrumentos lo-fi, o disco Acústico-Sucateiro evidenciou a capacidade de experimentar e inovar da banda. Além de disponibilizado para download gratuito, o material – que traz ainda a inédita “Na Ponta dos Pés” – saiu em fita cassete.\r\n\r\nNovamente, com projeto gráfico ousado desenvolvido por Felipe Oliveira e ilustrado pelo cartunista Diego Gerlach, o lançamento incentiva o público a reciclar ideias e materiais. No encarte, a banda convida os fãs a também lançarem mão de objetos do dia-a-dia para criar arte e, nas apresentações, propõe que o público leve fitas cassetes (novas ou usadas) para serem trocadas por cópias do Acústico-Sucateiro.\r\n\r\nA iniciativa abriu possibilidades para o grupo, que passou a realizar intervenções em lugares públicos das cidades que visita em turnê, como praças, parques, estações de metrô e pequenos teatros históricos, numa eficiente estratégia de ocupação e revalorização de espaços urbanos, para além da ampliação de plateias e contato contíguo com seu público.\r\n\r\nJunto e misturado\r\nDa síntese das duas experiências, nasceu o espetáculo Elétrico-Acústico-Sucateiro, que estreou com sucesso em Porto Alegre, com convidados, cenário, iluminação e projeções especiais, e catarse do público em noites de sessões duplas – que devem percorrer teatros de outras cidades em breve.\r\n\r\nNo momento, o quarteto trabalha no clipe de “Nescafé”, considerada uma das melhores músicas de 2010. A canção recentemente foi cantada em show por Vitor Ramil e seu filho Ian (parceiro de Kumpinski nesta composição e também em “Um Rei e o Zé”) e está no álbum de estreia do cantor Filipe Catto, lançado pela Universal.\r\n\r\nO Apanhador Só promete novo disco para 2012. Algumas músicas já aparecem no set list das apresentações do grupo – como “Torcicolo”, “Mas Não”, “Ele se Acordou”, “Salão de Festas”, “Cartão Postal” e “Paraquedas” – e apontam caminhos ensolarados para o futuro do grupo, mantendo o foco em experimentos que testam os limites do pop.','Pamela Leme | 11-7319-8840 | pamela@alavanca.art.br','http://www.facebook.com/apanhadorso/info','http://www.apanhadorso.com','http://soundcloud.com/apanhadorso','','0','11141',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','apanhador-so'),(147,0,0,0,'HOLY OTHER','','(UK) keongwoo [at] familyltd.co.uk (USA) heathcliff.berru [at] gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/holyother/info','','http://soundcloud.com/holyother','','0','11113',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','holy-other'),(148,0,2,2,'GODS ROBOTS','The seamless blend of catchy English lyrics, classical Indian instrumentation and underground rhythms defines the unique Gods Robots sound.

Fans and enthusiasts worldwide have come to love the sympathetic Dutchman for his affectionate sound, unique productions and dynamic DJ sets, which have taken him from Mexico to Russia, and almost everywhere in between. And it\'s not just the fans that are moved by his work; avid followers include internationally renowned DJs such as Hern?°n Catt?°neo, Sasha and Dave Seaman, who repeatedly drop his tracks in clubs and festivals around the world.\r\n\r\nEelke\'s real breakthrough came in 2006 when Nick Warren included \'8 Bit Era\' on his \'GU 030: Paris\' compilation. A few months later, Global Underground snapped up his debut artist album \'Naturally Artificial\', which hit the market late 2007 and received critical acclaim from press and reviewers worldwide. The attention from an international best-selling label also sky rocketed his DJ career, playing at massive events such as Moonpark in Buenos Aires, Dance Valley, Extrema Outdoor and Sensation to club gigs at the world famous Warung in Brazil and Privilege Ibiza.\r\n\r\nThroughout the years, Eelke\'s increasing profile has given him the opportunity to remix numerous well known acts and DJs, including Way Out West, Hybrid, Miss Nine and Sander Kleinenberg. His area of work extends well beyond the borders of conventional dance music however, having written music for clients such as NIKE & Joolz and often being credited as a mixing and mastering engineer for various artists and labels.\r\n\r\nBesides his work as a DJ and producer, Eelke also successfully runs the record label \'Outside the Box Music\', launched in 2006. His similarly named radio show and podcast has grown into an internet sensation, reaching tens of thousands of people each month.\r\n\r\nOn November 24th Eelke released his second artist album, \'Untold Stories\', on Manual Music. The philosophy behind his second full-length album is that music should be continuous, an uninterrupted, emotional experience. Having written the album as one single piece instead of a collection of individual tracks, Untold Stories is truly Eelke\'s way of pushing boundaries with music. The album received great reviews and international DJ support by the likes of Hernan Catanneo and Nick Warren.\r\n\r\nWith a second solo album released and an incredible amount of work to look back upon, Eelke Kleijn establishes himself not just as another producer or DJ, but as a modern day electronic composer.','Urban Rebel PR: vass@urbanrebelpr.com','http://www.facebook.com/eelkekleijn/info','http://www.eelkekleijn.nl','http://www.soundcloud.com/eelke-kleijn','','0','10361',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','eelke-kleijn-official'),(150,0,2,2,'Zygnema','*Their Achievements*:\r\n\r\nHeadlined Resonance at Terna College, Nerul on 14th March 2012.\r\nHeadlined Transfusion 2011, Goa -

Uday Benegal (vocals), Mahesh Tinaikar (guitar), Mark Selwyn (bass), Jayesh Gandhi (guitar), Zubin Balaporia (keyboards) and Mark Menezes (drums) first came together in 1985. Then called Rock Machine, the guys had no mission or plan. Just an unflagging desire to play the music they loved. In the face of all reason (there was just one government-run TV channel and radio station, neither of which thought rock’n’roll to be particularly \"cultural\") the band set out to do just that. It took blood, guts and a steely resolve to cut through the crap. It was just a matter of time before practically every college and concert promoter in the country wanted to book what had become India’s favourite band. The rest is history. They recorded three albums, won a bunch of awards and changed their name to Indus Creed. And in the process they inspired an entire generation to pick up an instrument and rock it out. Here’s a quick roundup of some of their multifarious achievements:\r\n• Toured the length and breadth of India\r\n• Repped the country at the Festival of India in the USSR\r\n• Played at Peter Gabriel\'s WOMAD festival in the UK\r\n• Performed with Bon Jovi to over 40,000 people in Bombay\r\n• Performed on stage with GN’R guitar player Slash for MTV’s launch in Bangalore\r\n• Toured the UK and the Middle East extensively','info@induscreed.net','http://www.facebook.com/IndusCreedNow/info','www.induscreed.net','http://soundcloud.com/induscreed','','0','9960',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','indus-creed'),(155,0,5,5,'Tara','TARA PRIYA is a retro-soul singer/songwriter born and raised in San Francisco, CA.

Since the formation in January 2004, Severe Dementia has been a band that embodies absolute brutality, blistering speed, technical proficiency and the utmost in quality extreme musicianship. In a country such as Bangladesh, where the people were previously unaware of devastating drum blasts, monstrous guttural growls, ravaging screams and pure aggression rendered guitar lines, Severe Dementia have become a major act to change that all over the years. Upon its formation, the band unleashed its own true form of death metal with utter ferocity that knew no bounds. Soon after, landing numerous successful gigs the band received great feedback from the local underground scene and the appreciation from the massive hordes of head bangers. Thus Severe Dementia has become the mightiest force that ever represented extreme metal from Bangladesh. \r\n\r\nIn February 2007, Severe Dementia signed a deal with Demonstealer Records (India) to release an EP in a split album “Rise of the Eastern Blood” with Demonic Resurrection (India), Dusk (Pakistan) and Helmksey (Singapore). The conceptual EP is entitled as “Epitaph of Plassey” with 5 continuous songs based on the historical Battle of Plassey between the British East India Company and the Bengal in 1757. Following that, Severe Dementia undertook a tour in India in April 2007 as being the first ever underground band from Bangladesh to play overseas. The opening of the album took place at the last gig of the tour on April 8 2007, at Razzberry Rhinoceros, Mumbai. The band played two gigs at Mumbai and Pune as the headliner unleashing on the unsuspecting crowd a torrent of unbelievably brutal, pulverizing and cataclysmic death metal. The band set the standards high and with the release of “Epitaph of Plassey”, showed the metal hordes worldwide that metal was well alive and kicking even from a country like Bangladesh. \r\n\r\nAfter a long break and suffering a few minor changes in the line-up, the revamped Severe Dementia resurfaced to take back their rightful dominion in the underground. The band has been working heavily on the writing and composing of new materials as well as the pre-production of its second official release, which would be the band’s first full length album since, “Epitaph of Plassey (EP, 2007)”. Although the name of the album had not been titled yet, the band announced that the album concept and lyrical themes would be based upon ancient Sumerian mythology. The approximate release date will be announced once the band completes the pre-production. \r\n','+88 01712 927 429','http://www.facebook.com/severedementia/info','http://www.severedementia.com','','','0','9224',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','severe-dementia'),(160,0,60,60,'ARSAMES','The First Persian Ancient Death Metal \r\nARSAMES\r\nArsames is an Ancient melodic death metal band from Iran, Arsames was formed in 2002 by Ali madarshahi ( frontman and first Drummer) in mashhad one of the largest City of Iran\r\nThe former members started to create their songs and playing them in their rehearsal room at the same time , the result was Songs :\r\n1-Homo sapiens 2-Cyrus The Great 3- Immortal Identity 4-Adipocere 5- Cyclopia (instrumental) 6-Exile , Metal music is banned in Iran so they couldn\'t release their songs\r\nthey decided to make an official web site to promote the band in Internet and follow that the myspace website in 2006 , they recorded all the tracks in a Home studio and put some of them in\r\ntheir myspace and start to promote ... the feed back was great so many fans joined their myspace to see how death metal sounds in Persia, the fans added bunch of comments and good vibes\r\nto their myspace and some magazines around the world ask them for Interview at that time , so they found a good energy for continuing\r\nin 2008 Metalcamp festival invited underground bands to joined a competition and between thousands of bands Arsames won to play in Metalcamp ...\r\nin 2009 an international 3days unirock festival in turkey invited them to play in istanbul turkey along with famous acts like:\r\nAmon Amarth , Arch enemy , Kreator ...and the last day of the fest they opened the stage for Amon Amarth and Arsames had an interview with metalhammer that night and it published in\r\nmetalhammer magazine in 2009 , they also played in Dorock bar in istanbul turkey few days later after they came back to Iran huge number of Turkish fans joined Arsames websites . in 2010 they invited\r\nto be the headliner and played in Metal asylum in Dubai\r\nin 2010 The band Decide to re record the first album with better quality an add some new tracks, now they have 9 studio tracks and It will be released worldwide in Nov 2010\r\nAlso they invited and played as headlining act in a huge metal festival in India Sikkim metal fest in Nov 2010','Alimadarshahe@yahoo.com ','http://www.facebook.com/pages/ARSAMES/111288558020?sk=info','http://www.arsames.net','','','0','9215',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','arsames'),(161,0,62,61,'Thieve','Nothing is original.

With the likes of Tharindu Mathew, Loshaarn Bastian, Mihindu Ariyarathne, and Sithija Dilshan, Nemesis boasts of consisting some of the most brilliant musicians in the island performing under its name. Since the inception of the band, Nemesis has strived greatly to improve the standards of rock music in Sri Lanka, while working tirelessly to convey rock music, which was only heard by a limited number of people in Colombo, to people in all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nIn year 2008, three years after its humble beginning, Nemesis managed to emerge victorious in one of the most coveted musical talent searches in Sri Lanka, TNL Onstage. Nemesis managed to secure the title for the best act in the band category, and with the best band title behind it, Nemesis erupted in to the rock scene with a force so hard, it was only a matter of time that they became the talk of the town. However, it was the release of its first single, Chakithaya, which bombarded Nemesis in to the mainstream music scene. With the launch of “Chakithaya”, Nemesis managed to accomplish the seemingly impossible. Nemesis managed to merge the secluded underground fans of rock, and the ordinary fans of mainstream music under a single song. But the journey did not stop from just that. \r\nFirst they were approached by a radio station all the way from Netherland requesting permission to feature “Chakithaya” on air in one of their programs. But the best was yet to come; the history was yet to be written. Just shortly after the request from the Netherlands, Nemesis received yet another call from another media firm; this time it was none other than the MTV itself. Nemesis went on to become the first Rock/Metal act in Sri Lankan history to be featured on MTV desi and MTV Iggy.

Blessed with a crushing sound, courtesy Lasse Lammert, LSD Studios, Germany and Resonance Studios, 4 tracks of the band’s own characteristic style unleashes rage upon the listener; storming, violent, old school infused metal.

Arguably one of the most eclectic metal bands around, Bhoomi have since gigged extensively all over India building a reputation as one of the most enthralling live acts to have surfaced from the rising metal scene in the country.\n\nWith their roots firmly entrenched in the classic metal of Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Queensryche and other seminal hard rock and metal bands of the 80\'s, Bhoomi are arguably one of the finest exponents of pure, melodic metal anyone is likely to find. Using traditional hard rock and metal as their base, Bhoomi stand out from the crowd with their unique incorporation of three way vocal harmonies into their music, which instantly gives them an identity and sound that is all their own. Throw in some classy songwriting and technical prowess into the mix and you have a band that can make you bang your head with pounding riffs and dazzle you with a catchy and superlatively melodic chorus before you get a chance to catch your breath. Another aspect of the band that has further endeared them to their fans is their lyrical stance,which rages against corruption and champions the cause of the common man.\n\nWith more than 200 gigs under their belt since their inception and a fully developed and mature sound, 2010 promises to be the year that puts Bhoomi on the international map with acclaimed grammy nominated producer Neil Kernon (Nevermore, Queensryche) set to work with the band to release their highly anticipated debut album on an unsuspecting world.','','http://www.facebook.com/metalbhoomi','','','','138717726169011','1365',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','bhoomi'),(171,0,3,65,'THE DOWN TRODDENCE','','Ganesh - +91 9535959095','http://www.facebook.com/THEDOWNTRODENCE/info','','http://soundcloud.com/thedowntroddence','','0','8296',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','the-down-troddence'),(172,0,1,1,'Jeremy Messersmith','','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jeremy-Messersmith/111950995488579','','http://soundcloud.com/jeremy-messersmith','','111950995488579','8270',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','jeremy-messersmith'),(173,0,2,66,'DJ Ravish','There are some people who just listen to music, but there are some creatures that live, eat and die on music. This young artist certainly belongs to the later category. \r\nAs one of Jaipur\'s most respected industry figures, 22 years old DJ Ravish has been spinning tunes for six years now. DJ Ravish (Ravi Sharma) was born in Nowgong (A small district in Assam) on 3rd August and he always had a real passion for music. As a teenager he started collecting every kind of music. After finishing secondary school his DJ adventure began when he started spinning at his friend’s party. DJing has always been a passion for him and he was exposed to musicality from a very young age. \r\nHe started off his journey from a very low level. Worked for local sound providers and understood the working of consoles. At the age of 13 he started playing for private gigs, inspired a passion for electronic music and an ambition to make a career in this fascinating, elusive little world. But that wasn’t enough for him. He always wanted to make it big. Ravish entered into professional DJing at the age of 15 and since then he has rocked some of the high-quality parties in Jaipur and his tunes are considered to be the most energetic and danceable around. \r\nBut it is for his Remixing and Production work that Ravish is now starting to make it on the Electronic music stage. He always had a curiosity for softwares, to make his own tunes. He started learning them by trail and error method, and soon learned to put together small, very simple pieces and produce his own bollywood remixes. Appreciation from some of the well-known figures of this industry made this artist never look back. After enough of club banging mash-up and some remixes from his side, he took a deep study of professional music production softwares to enhance his skills and scope of remixing. After that his remixes have taken him to new heights, with all new funky, punchier basslines and kickinn’ kicks to bang the speakers. His newest bootleg releases are getting appreciation from all over.\r\nDJ Ravish does not only know how to play his tunes, he sure knows how to organize a thumping party as well. He is known for his set of House Music, especially when it comes to sub-genre Electro House. He owns a very special set of electro house, comprising some of the very best of the International music scene, enough to make party people raise their eye-brows and go crazy. He always maintains a healthy combination of both Bollywood and House music ensuring the feets on the dance floor doesn’t sleeps. His friendly, funny nature and sense for quality music are the jewels for any event.\r\nCurrently one of the very few artists of Jaipur who is into music production, He is working hard to provide quality music to the city and the nation. When the word remixing was unknown for most of the DJs out there in the city, Ravish was already making his own mixes for inclusion in the show. Inspired by few of the big shot DJs of India viz. DJ Nyk, DJ Aqeel, DJ A-Myth, he is making his own way mixing the best of tracks into an even better mix. \r\nIt is said that sky is the limit, but in the words of this young talent “I have to make my way beyond the sky, into the stars”. So, if you are a music freak it is advised to keep an eye on this self-made boy because he will keep you going and making you coming back for more.','','http://www.facebook.com/deejayravishofficial/info','http://www.djravish.in','','','0','8009',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','dj-ravish'),(174,0,2,2,'Devoid','Devoid was formed in the year 2005.

This predominantly thrash based band soon felt the need for a bass guitarist and the search went on till finally Devoid saw its new permanent bassy, Frank Pawar. Devoid kicked off its gigging spree from College Rock Competitions of the likes of Campus Rock Idols which was a strong stepping stone for the band to reach heights that they had not thought was possible. Coupled with a string of local pub gigs and outstation performances, Devoid soon established its fan base. A lot of this had to do with the fact that the setlist for Devoid was all-out originals. With the fan base steadily increasing Devoid started touring with big names in the scene like IIIrd Sovereign, Demonic Resurrection, Myndsnare, Kryptos, Brute Force, Infernal Wrath etc covering places like Pune, Hyderabad, Delhi, Shillong and of course Bombay. From then on to now, Devoid has come up with 8 crushing songs that saw the crowd screaming and moshing along. Slowly setting up a scene that is waiting to erupt.

Singh (Amogh Symphony) and Sunneith Revankar (Bhayanak Maut).\r\n\r\nSkyharbor will release the debut album ‘Blinding White Noise: Illusion & Chaos’ worldwide via Basick Records in early 2012\r\n\r\n\r\nQUOTES:\r\n\r\n“I think you do some amazing work. Would love to hear more – it’s awesome.” – Marty Friedman (Megadeth, Cacophony)\r\n\r\n\"Right now, I am very much into a band called Skyharbor from India\" - Chris Adler (Lamb of God)\r\n\r\n“The stuff Keshav plays will blow your mind; not merely because it’s super complex in the patented “djent” stylee, but because of the number of ideas he inserts into the music. The fact that Keshav manages to record – and perform – the music as a solo artist is mindblowing. He must have four hands and three brains, and the thought of him joining a band of likeminded musicians is rather frightening. Remember Hammer’s recent trip to India to check out the local metal scene? Well, with artists like this, it won’t stay local for long.” – Joel McIver\r\n\r\n“With its fast-growing metal scene, is it any wonder that India has its foot in the door with this nascent scene? Skyharbor is, incredibly, just one guy: Keshav Dhar.” – Metal Hammer (UK) Magazine\r\n\r\n“I met a guy in India, Keshav Dhar, […] he is writing some fantastic music; almost Chimp Spanner meets Textures. It’s like a combination of everything that’s going off at the minute.” – Daniel Tompkins (TesseracT, First Signs of Frost, PIANO)\r\n\r\n“If you’re looking to get into your first Indian band, I’d recommend (Keshav’s) stuff, Skyharbor!” – Jamie Postones (TesseracT, Heights)\r\n\r\n“Our friend Keshav Dhar from India is creating some cool stuff with his band Skyharbor” – Bart Hennephof (Textures)\r\n\r\n“Keshav’s riffs scare the crap out of me” – Vishal J. Singh (Amogh Symphony)\r\n\r\n“Brainchild of Indian guitar ace Keshav Dhar, this musical powerhouse is a heart pounding contribution to the poly-rhythmic low-end sub-genre of metal (known by name as ‘Djent’) rising in popularity over recent years. […] With a CD release set for this coming June, 2011 may hopefully be the year that this musically stunning brand name finally takes form.” – Ashley Jacob, Suite 101 (www.suite101.com)\r\n\r\n“Underground act from India!

It wasn’t until the band hit the studio, in the summer of 2004 to record their debut EP “Human Chaos” that they began to be recognized internationally. The release immediately grabbed attention from the underground metal scenes around the globe and gained them an international fan base, who were pummeled by mosh inciting songs like “Human Chaos” and “Demolition”; instantly securing NERVECELL a place on the global metal map. The success of “Human Chaos” allowed Nervecell the opportunity to perform in front of 6000 people at the annual Dubai Desert Rock Festival in 2005, opening for the legendary SEPULTURA and the mighty MACHINE HEAD. \r\n\r\nSoon after, Nervecell were seen headlining metal concerts in Dubai and even headlining the Egypt Metal Festival 2007 in Cairo. At this point Nervecell embarked on a headlining Australian tour in 2007, culminating with a headlining slot at Metalstock Festival 2007, Australia\'s only 3 day metal festival, and the Australian Road Rage Tour. \r\n\r\nIt wasn’t too long before the European fans got to see Nervecell head out their way later that year when the band were confirmed for Metalcamp Festival 2007 in Tolmin, Slovenia, alongside KREATOR, AMON AMARTH, IMMORTAL, and many others. Both the press and metal fans alike began to notice the unstoppable progress of the band! Nervecell were creating history at a time when releasing albums, touring extensively and playing international stages wasn’t an option considered by their peers back in the UAE. \r\n\r\nBy 2008, while the Middle East metal scene was on the rise, Nervecell were at the forefront of it all; having released a highly acclaimed EP and toured extensively on an international scale. After performing before 28,000 people at 2008’s edition of Dubai Desert Rock Festival, alongside As I Lay Dying, Machine Head, and Killswitch Engage; Nervecell decided to take time off from the live circuit to focus on recording their first full length. \r\n\r\nIn April 2008 Nervecell released the highly anticipated album “Preaching Venom”, featuring PSYCROPTIC\'s drummer David Haley. The album was mixed by the acclaimed producers Wojtek and Slawek Wieslawscy (VADER, DECAPITATED, HATE) at Hertz Studio in Poland and mastered by the infamous Alan Douches at West West Side Music (SEPULTURA, SUFFOCATION, UNEARTH) in New Windsor, New York. \r\n\r\nThe success that followed the release of “Preaching Venom” went beyond expectations; the album received immense feedback from all four corners of the world including top reviews from well established magazines such as Metal Hammer, Rock Hard, Legacy, and Metal Edge among others. \r\n\r\nBy February/March 2009 Nervecell kicked off the “Beyond The Venom” tour, which included an appearance at the Dubai Desert Rock Festival 2009 with MOTÖRHEAD, ARCH ENEMY, OPETH, CHIMAIRA and others. Not only did 2009 see Nervecell come under the management of Center Stage Management and sign an artist deal with Spellbind Records but it also marked the band’s first European Festival Tour. Consisting of a 3-month extensive tour of the continent in the summer of 2009, it included performances at Wacken Open Air (20th Year Anniversary) where they played in front of 70,000, With Full Force, Metal GDL, Mass Deathtruction, Way of Darkness Festival, Rock Am Ring, Rock Im Park to name a few. Nervecell’s appearance at the latter two festivals made them the first metal band from the Middle East to perform on their stages. \r\n\r\nWhile on tour the band gained the attention of Lifeforce Records. Shortly after Nervecell returned home and signed an international record deal with the German label. Yet again, marking another remarkable breakthrough for a Middle East based metal band! “Preaching Venom” was officially released throughout Europe and the UK on October 26th 2009. \r\n\r\nStefan Luedicke, CEO of Lifeforce Records, stated that “We are more than happy to welcome Dubai’s premier Death Metal band on Lifeforce. We hardly ever met a band with such strong work ethic” \r\n\r\nWith Lifeforce Records now supporting Nervecell, the band decided to return to Europe to celebrate the European release of “Preaching Venom”. A headlining Preaching Venom European Tour was quickly announced, scheduled to run throughout September/October 2009 in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Austria and Portugal. \r\n\r\nAfter working relentlessly for 2 years on promoting “Preaching Venom” the band returned back to the UAE for a well earned break. \r\n\r\nIt was early 2010 and Nervecell headed back to Europe and the UK for 26 shows supporting New York Death Metal icons, Suffocation, on their Legacy of Blood Tour in March 2010. This was followed by a tour in Turkey, opening for the legendary Deicide in April 2010. \r\n\r\nIt was half way into 2010 and the time was right for Nervecell to finally head out East to perform for the countless fans located all around the Middle East. The band also went on to tour in countries such as India and Sri Lanka, where Nervecell were seen supporting As I Lay Dying. \r\n\r\nThe year 2011 has a lot in store for Nervecell, starting with the band bringing in the New Year with updates from the studio; so you can expect to catch Nervecell back again with yet another ground breaking album that continues to combine the old school death metal ethics of raw brutality intertwined with modern thrash metal elements of no-holds barred aggression and speed. The album is tentatively scheduled for a March 2011 release through Lifeforce Records in Europe and Spellbind Records in the Middle East. Rest assured the legacy of Nervecell will only continue to aspire many and grow further…from the Middle East and beyond!','press@spellbindrecords.com','http://www.facebook.com/nervecell/info','http://www.nervecell.net','','http://www.reverbnation.com/nervecell','0','7345',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','nervecell'),(181,0,68,69,'Zutopian','','','http://www.facebook.com/djzutopian/info','','','','0','7273',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','zutopian'),(182,2,1,1,'Parikrama','A Rock and Roll band from Delhi, India, they have several live performances and original numbers to their name.

After some persuasion with a little food and drink from the cafeteria and Food court, he convinced Vicky to join as The Bass Player!! After a few days of jamming, Jerry started losing interest (apparently the band outranked him in terms of fatness!!). We decided to call ourselves All The Fat Children, Jerry left soon after!! Sam was found at a gig through a band we knew, which would be Slain (Bless their Souls)!! And within a week and a half, we jammed and jammed and jammed......etc etc...Till we thought our limbs would drop, praying to the lord that we get to keep them after the gig as well!! After a few rehearsals, the band played their debut show. Since then, the band has been playing at all available shows in bangalore and the rest of India!!

Vulnerable vocals give way to oceans of sound retaining definition via deftly layered\r\nguitar parts augmented by lingering synths which alternate between background and center stage.\r\n\r\nThis past June, Now, Now, a trio composed of Cacie Dalager (Vocals, Guitar), Jess Abbot (Vocals, Guitar), and\r\nBrad Hale (Drums, Synth) packed up their van and drove 1800 miles across North America to record with Redekopp\r\nin Vancouver, BC. Beyond the geographical shift, the recording felt miles removed from their full-length debut\r\nCars. Released in 2008 prior to Abbot joining the band, Cars saw the fresh out of High School Dalager and Hale\r\ntraveling the United States non-stop and finding their way onto European arena tours. Through word of mouth and\r\nconstant touring, Now, Now (formerly Now, Now Every Children) began building a support system of fans and\r\nfriends, including Maine native, Abbot. Hale and Dalager quickly became fans of the music Abbot was making\r\nin other bands; “It was kind of funny because she and I used to make jokes about how in an alternate universe we\r\nwould probably be in a band together,\" recalls Dalager. “We had a practice where she played for us the parts she\r\nhad written for songs off Cars, recalls Hale. It was apparent from those sessions Abbot could bring something to\r\nNow, Now. “Her guitar work is amazing,” says Dalager, “and just adding another creative brain into the mix was\r\nrefreshing for us.”\r\n\r\nSoon enough, Abbot relocated to the Twin Cities to become the third member of Now, Now Every Children, sharing\r\nequally in songwriting and vocal contributions. Dropping “Every Children” from their name, Now, Now began\r\nworking on the Neighbors EP, an experiment in writing and recording for the first time as a three piece. Though\r\nthe original plan was to self-release the EP, it found a home at No Sleep Records, who encouraged the band to tour\r\nthrough the first half of 2011.\r\n\r\nIt was during this time another relationship formed during the years following Cars began to grow. Chris Walla,\r\nguitarist/producer of Death Cab for Cutie, had taken an interest in the band’s music. “From the very first time we\r\nhad contact with him,” explains Hale, “he was always excited and positive about things.” Support from an artist\r\nthey admired musically and personally proved inspiring to Now, Now. At SXSW 2011 Walla came to each of their\r\nshows, helped them lug gear and even talked a police officer out of giving them a parking ticket. With mutual\r\nadmiration all around, it was natural for Now, Now to sign to Walla’s Trans- Records. “In working with Chris and\r\nhis label,” explains Abbot, “we’ve been given a lot of freedom to make sure we’re happy with the music. We run at\r\na slower place as a band, and he’s not pushed us, but instead given us our time. It’s nice to have that from somebody\r\nwho could probably sign any number of bands, and make them do what he wants.”\r\n\r\nWith a true sense of purpose and excitement they hadn’t felt in years, Now, Now made the trip to meet with\r\nRedekopp to record Threads. “What people will specifically notice about the songs on Threads,” says Hale, “is the\r\nway that they are put together. We spent a lot of time going through the basic song ideas and restructuring them to\r\nmake them their best. Since we haven\'t released a full-length in so long,\" he explains, \"we wanted to make sure we\r\nwere all loving everything about it before we went all the way out there to record.” Between recording and tracking\r\nat three studios in Vancouver, the band would hang out with Redekopp at his house or watch him hit the half pipe at\r\na local skate park. ”He became an extended member of the band;” explains Dalager, “he got inside our heads and\r\nunderstood everything we were going for.” During the recording Now, Now could tell they were hitting their stride\r\nfor the first time. “As happy as we are with Neighbors,” Abbot says, “a lot of things didn’t click because we were\r\njust learning how to write together.” Dalager notes, “We killed ourselves over Threads. That sounds dramatic, but\r\neverything about it was excruciating in a good way. Every little idea was worked to its best.” As a result, “this is the\r\nfirst release we feel really proud of.”\r\n\r\nWith the album complete, Now, Now look to the future with great anticipation. “This band feels like an extension\r\nof us as people,” explains Dalager. “It’s something we’ve been nurturing for a long time and is all we really care\r\nabout;something we’ve worked really hard for and need to make happen no matter what.”','Chris Vinyard at Big Hassle Media','http://www.facebook.com/NowNowMusic/info','http://nownowband.com','http://soundcloud.com/now-now','','0','5944',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','now-now'),(206,0,3,3,'Galeej Gurus','The Galeej Gurus are a band that believes in exploring music and also to have as much fun as possible doing it. \r\n\r\nThey have been on the circuit since 2000 & played over 500 gigs within & outside the country.\r\n\r\nAfter over nine years of touring and performing, the Galeej Gurus are working towards the release of their debut album in 2010. \r\n\r\nThe Galeej Gurus, in 2008, won SHAMAL - Dubai’s very \r\nown International Battle of the Bands and performed at the Dubai Desert Rock Festival (Asia’s Largest Music Festival) alongside Velvet Revolver, Muse, Korn, Machinehead, Killswitch Engage, As I Lay Dying & Slapshock. \r\n\r\nIn India, the Galeej Gurus have also opened for legendary rockers such as MR.

The band strongly believes that to tackle any hurdle in life, one has to have that zeal to make it through and has to persist with the same in order to make things work out.\nDuring the journey, the band has learnt that “living is not the same thing as making a life” and while shaping themselves for the showdown they drew the required inspiration from metalcore and melodic death metal bands like All That Remains, Heaven Shall Burn, The Black Dahlia Murder, As I Lay Dying, Lamb of God, Killswitch Engage, Devil driver and likes. All may not be mentioned but none is nonetheless forgotten!\nChronic Xorn is presently working on its first EP – “Death.Destruction.Sermon” which is currently at the pre-production stage.

Some other reputed Indian metal bands who changed their sound to more ‘technical and experimental’ side are Infernal Wrath and Undying Inc. North-east part of India is growing up giving birth to a bunch progressive and technical metal bands and solo artists in the last 2 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nVishal, born in April 1986, is a multi-instrumentalist, composer and producer based in Bombay, India. Vishal began his career in music as a Drummer-cum-percussionist. He started playing the guitar at the age of 11 and drums at the age of 13. Vishal belongs from a musical family with both his parents are musicians. Born of a Guitarist Father and a Classical singer/dancer mother, Vishal grew up in a family of music where he taught himself how to play and write music. Initially, his elder brother Vikram J.Singh(who is now a software corporate) taught him how to play the guitar. He moved to Mumbai from his hometown Duliajan(Assam) to pursue a carrier as session guitarist and composer. Vishal, now, apart from his project Amogh Symphony, composes music for big brand TV commercials, Radio jingles and also produces International as well as Indian bands and artists. His projects includes some of the most niche and experimental artists and bands across the Globe with an intention to produce a unique record. Some of his main influences were Al Dimeola, Paco De Lucia, Gene Hoglan, Death, Gorguts, Ozric Tentacles, Tony Macalpine, Shawn Lane, Chick Correa, Prodigy, Yngwie Malmsteen, Stevie Ray Vaughan and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Drummer Jim Richman. It all started when young Jim got a snare drum kit at age 4 after seeing Elvis Presley\'s drummer on TV. At 14, Jim bought a drumset and the next day started playing in a cover high school band with his twin brother George Richman. \r\n\r\nJim played in Malefice and recorded 7 songs to be found on the Lotus Blossum LP on Lost and Found Records. He also went to VA Tech and studied Jazz with the late Joe Kennedy Jr. Jim also attended Drummers Collective in NYC, hooking up with Pete Zeldman, Frank Katz, Mike Clarke and many others and studied with Jim Chapin, Joe Morello and Gary Chaffee.\r\n\r\nBeing as Jim was very serious in drums, he wanted to study them with the masters. After College, Jim played in many different groups and  recorded an EP with Dizzy Dizzy, featuring members of Government Issue and 76% Uncertain. But soon he decided to quit that band to join a Variety Wedding band and played the Nascar Circuit in many Holiday Inns. He played in various groups, opening for Angela Bofil, Joan Jett, the Meat Puppets. \r\n\r\nThe technical metal/fusion journey started with Modulus. He formed Modulus and played as a two man project, initially. They recorded the Prototype EP, engineered mixed and mastered by Jim Richman himself. Modulus opened for many top extreme metal acts at the legendary Jaxx Nightclub for a few years before the band fell apart. \r\nJim also recorded a couple of tribute tracks with Aurora Borealis released on Dwell Records. He is a fulltime Drum Teacher for almost 15 years. Now, Jim devotes his time to his family, job, Amogh Symphony, Hypnorock, and sub for a variety of gigs as Session Drummer that pay good money. Jim also play keyboards as a composer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbolishing the Obsolete System, their first full-length album, was released in April 2009. Soon after 5 months of this album\'s release, Jim Richman joined Amogh Symphony as permanent drummer. Their second album, The Quantum Hack Code, was released in 2010, receiving positive attention from critics and non-professional listeners alike. For many critics and reviewers, TQHC is one of the top progressive metal releases of the year 2010 and 2011 as well with it\'s own unique tradmark sound of technical metal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome reviews from Media about the latest album The Quantum Hack Code : \r\n\r\n\"Todo ello sin que suene forzado, de una manera muy natural y como no, mérito de Vishal, que se erige como un músico realmente despierto y con un talento muy pocas veces visto en este tipo de música. Todo realizado con mimo y esmero, con mucha elegancia y clase, desde sus guitarras rítmicas, bajo, samplers, baterías…e incluso la propia producción del trabajo.\" - Pitchline Zine, Spanish extreme metal webzine\r\n\r\n\"In a time where guitarists/producers seem to be gravitating towards a djenty sound, Vishal avoids chug like the plague, instead opting for virtuosity and picking and choosing genre styles to his liking through experimentation and soloing. After you finish listening to The Quantum Hack Code, you’ll be thinking, “Tosin Abasi, who?” \" - Heavy Blog is Heavy\r\n\r\n\"Vishal is a mad scientist and that will be understood after a few listens. I am reviewing the album as a whole epic song because that\'s how concept albums should be treated and rated. With most modern technical bands jumping on the Djent train as their musical direction, Vishal avoids it and formed his own melting pot of various techniques and styles that will no doubt get him the virtuosic recognition he and Amogh Symphony more than deserve. The mastering done on this album needs to be commended. Aditya Naik has succeeded in not making this album sound like a trashcan being shoved into your eardrum with glass shards. While most modern metal albums feature brick wall mastering and usually end up being clipped, this album has a user-friendly sound that lets the user mould it to how he or she likes music.\" - Metal Assault\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At its heart, The Quantum Hack Code is a defiantly adventurous ride, throwing at the listener every manner of complex and varied instrumental music spanning multiple genres, coupled with dextrous and versatile percussion, in a format that might not be immediately digestible. In fact, it\'s almost an understatement to say this album is a challenging listen, demanding complete attention, an ear for detail and a tolerance for a wide spectrum of styles. The instrumental performances on display are faultless, Singh effortlessly switching between frenzied, jagged riffing and silky funk vamps with remarkable ease, accompanied by Richman\'s intricate yet tasteful drum work. The inherent penchant for diversity and eclecticism makes The Quantum Hack Code far and away the most colourful and fresh album I\'ve heard this year. \"  - Sea of Traquility\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is not an easy album to get into and requires multiple listens to fully digest all aspects of it. \" - Indianrockmp3\r\n\r\n\"It’s a very, very dense piece of work, and as such can be a bit overwhelming at first, like all great technical metal albums. It’s definitely not the sort of album you can just jump right into, but the real reward here is listening to the album multiple times so as to absorb the various elements at play here.\" - The Number of The Blog/Fucking Metal Reviews\r\n\r\n\"This is one album you need to listen to and when you do, you’ll realize that Vishal Singh does not need any form of mindless, shameless promotion for his music or infact even reviews such as this for he has now established himself as no less than a genius atleast in the eyes of people who know and understand music.\" - Demrockritic\r\n\r\n\"Rapid tempo and key changes at the drop of a hat, transitions from futuristic metal groove and mind-bending guitar solos to Spanish folk with surgical precision, all leave one thinking about how far we’ve really come. This is a true melting pot of modern musical genius, equal parts abrasive and melancholy, performed and produced by men who are at the absolute peak of their prowess. \" - Underground.in / Keshav Dhar a.k.a Skyharbor\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This album gives it all – progressive, jazz, funk, blues, flamenco, tech-death, classical, even trance. Vishal Singh’s music has evolved to the point where it took me 8 listens to be even vaguely confident about writing a review. But that does not imply it being a blatant display of virtuosity and technical prowess. The slower passages accentuate the dystopian feel that this album tries to get across quite succinctly, and the last track “The Collapse of Q-Web And Osiris” portrays the revival of humanity exceedingly well.\" - Headbangers India\r\n\r\n\"Geek/Nerd metal for the masses with an open mind.  That is the best way to describe the sophomore effort from the 1 man band Amogh Symphony.  Vishaljit Singh has surely stated his case for being the best solo project in the metal these days based on the superb album Quantum Hack Code.  Quantum Hack Code has extremely impressive sound, PLENTY of different genres, plenty of technicality to the musicianship, multitudes of changes throughout the songs and a concept/theme to the entire album.\" - RYM\r\n\r\n\"Quantum Hack Code CD music None of the songs on the album are similar to another. Everything from fast tempos, groovy rythms, great guitar solos and precise vocals. The music is basically based on guitar riffs, so if that is what you\'re looking for you ...\" - CD Universe\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes it’s like Christopher Nolan joined hands with Devin Townsend to make history. Personally, i think it could be the soundtrack of Matrix. This album is a fuel for musical intelligence and creative thoughts for any music loving brain. I highly recommend this album to Engineeringand PhD Students. Solve your problems with this record on, you will be posessed by Einstein’s ghost.\" - Groovy Djenty Blog/14all-all41\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Future is here. \" - Got-Djent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome reviews from Media about the last album Abolishing the obsolete system : \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“A dense mash of genres – there’s everything from electronica to jazz to technical death metal here – the sounds on the album weave impossible structures with masterly musicianship. Amogh Symphony’s raised the bar for experimental metal in the country to heights that other bands can only hope to aspire towards.” – Rolling Stone, India \r\n\r\n“Abolishing the obsolete system is an extremely diverse album. It features many aspects of nearly all the genres of music. From hardcore Trance to Technical Death Metal riffs, Vishal J.Singh has it all! The tempo is never constant on this album, meaning it\'s a Progressive Metal album. The album is so unique and unheard before that trying to describe it to you would seem useless. Just give it a try, and embrace the originality behind the songwriting from this multi-faceted Indian 1-man band! “ – RateYourMusic \r\n\r\n“It is instrumental prog death that alternates between very aggressive and more technical metal to some very nice atmospheric metal.  A few of the tracks certainly have some jazz influence and we also get some very interesting electronica on a couple of tracks and even some \"Indian\" ethnic vocals/sounds added here and there. “ – RYM\r\n\r\n\"One side - World was tripping on Djent. This side - Metal was never so unique and versatile before. This man is truly a genius.\" - Hazard Noize \r\n\r\n“What makes the album so different from other acts of this genre is the simple fact that Vishal plays an intricate style of technical Death Metal in the album fusing Jazz elements wonderfully alongside Indian classical music influences as well as techno-synth sounds as heard in tracks like Cyborg Activation and Abolishing The Obsolete System. And its the inclusion of such structures that soon engulfs the listener in a cosmic atmosphere, making him anticipate each track with such a zeal that pretty soon he may find his head banging to the beats of the album.The whole album unquestionably sounds like one great song where every track sounds like a part of a greater track, with every track maintaining it\'s own unique identity. And this is where lies Amogh Symphony\'s beauty. Single masterpieces joining together in greater harmony to form a larger magnum opus. Amogh Symphony pulls off a brilliant masterpiece in his new album without any flaws worth mentioning. The magic Vishal spins with his skills is simply awe-inspiring”. – Metalhead Chronicles \r\n\r\n“From start to finish, this album is just weaving in and out of death metal, techno-ish synth breakdowns, and Indian-styled music infused within one another. Every track fuses within one another, making the whole album feel like one great song, even so with the identical riffage in \"Cyborg Activation\" and \"Swallowing The Infected Sun\" (the only track with vocals on it). Though flowing within one another, the tracks each carry a separate but together identify, making each song different from the last, but carrying identical styles from Vishal that make it feel like one album, not tracks thrown together. Even without the death growling that is a staple for this genre, this whole album carries a death metal vibe, whether weak or strong depending on song, makes this album approachable to anyone who is not familiar (or hates) death metal. “ – CMK Music Review.\r\n\r\n“Cambios que te mueven en segundos desde el Death metal más elaborado y rajao, pasando por interludios acústicos sacados del medio oriente y luego llegando a bases electrónicas acompañadas con guitarra Jazz Lo que hace AMOGH SYMPHONY en su disco debut, se podría catalogar a la rápida como Death Metal Progresivo, pero sería pobre quedarse con eso no más. La banda te lleva en un viaje cósmico lleno de atmósferas logradas gracias al buen uso de bases electrónicas y de ritmos sincopados”. – Brutal Zone / Hellcast.  \r\n\r\n“??? ???? ?????? ???? ??? ??????? ???????, ???  ??????????? ?? ?????, ?? ? ??????? ???? ???????. ???????? ??????-??????????? ???? - ??????, ??????, ?????? ??? ???? ???????????? – ?? ?? ???????? ?? ?????, ????? ??? ???????. ?? ????? ?? ?????? ? ???????? ?? ?????, ????????? “Abolishing the Obsolete System.

Swapnil was there to answer the ad, hoping against hope to find musical resonance.\r\n\r\nThey found a lot in common, eventually. The determination to create rock music that goes beyond imitation. To sing about life as they lived it, not some Westerner on a dark desert highway. To not care about aping the stars, but to express what they felt, in the language they thought in.\r\n\r\nThe first rivers of thought merged – Prayag was formed. With the help of an old friend, Hitesh, a few initial compositions – including the basic structure of the now popular Tejo Mahalaya – were created. A few months later Kiran Roy was invited to record for the band and became the lead guitarist for Prayag along with Pradeep Radhakrishnan on drums. Kiran played a major role in the composition of the song Raaste, which still never fails to rock a live audience.\r\n\r\nPrayag hit the usual bottlenecks. Record companies wanted remixes, not original material. Pradeep vanished into thin air (we still don’t know where he is). Differences saw Kiran bid adieu. Swapnil and Pranab were left with an album no one wanted. The inevitable tensions followed. Their determination to do rock music was being tested.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Viru – who had engineered Prayag’s initial songs along with Mr Rajesh Ranjan Singh of the erstwhile Throatlatch Records – was invited to try his hand on the drums. And it was clear from the first snare shot that here was a guy with rhythm in his blood.\r\n\r\nA few days later Swapnil came across another online ad, posted by a guitarist wanting to play “any kind of music.” His name was Sumit. Sounded pretty ordinary. He even looked the sober, workingman type. But all that changed when he strapped his guitar on.\r\n\r\nSwapnil, Pranab and Viru were stunned. Sumit hemmed and hawed at first, but later accepted the invitation to join the band, and suggested taking another guitar player along with him. So in came Pasha, full of life and enthusiasm. The rivers had merged. Prayag was ready to rock. Big time.

And it is indeed quite a miracle that a few talented and skilled individuals from extremely diverse musical backgrounds could come together and in a very short while realize their dream to create and play rousing music while transcending boundaries of influences, genres and stereotypes.\r\n\r\nAfter winning several rock band competitions across Delhi like Jamia Hamdard, PGDAV, Dyal Singh and CVS to name a few, Nasya headlined at colleges like Miranda House and Lady Irwin College in 2009.\r\n\r\nThe hysteria of 2009 paled in comparison with the euphoria of 2010.

How ironical that Vedic Metal originated in a tiny island in South East Asia instead of India, the land of Vedic Mysticism and sacrifices. Although the band has been alive since 1992, it was in 1998 that the world finally got a taste of what this legendary outfit had to offer the world of Metal. The debut album was a revolutionary and unprecedented statement in extreme metal at the time. The good production in spite of it being recorded with a shoestring budget and its unique songwriting amazed reviewers around the world. The lyrical theme being the ancient Vedic philosophies made RUDRA really the founders of this genre.\r\n\r\n2001\'s ‘The Aryan Crusade’ cemented RUDRA’s reputation as truly innovative and visionary composers by pushing the boundaries of their previous offering further. Till date many fans around the world consider this album to be definitive Vedic Metal album.  \'The Aryan Crusade\' retained the extreme metal sound along with their exotic sound that had become their trademark and took it to another dimension. \r\n\r\nWith two groundbreaking albums behind them, the band had become a force destined for recognition further outside of the ever evolving metal community. In 2003, they started to put out concept albums and ‘Kurukshetra’ was released with the theme taken off the famous battle featured in the Indian epic Mahabharata. \'Kurukshetra\' proved that RUDRA can also be fine Death/Black Metal musicians.  \r\n2005 marked another turning point for the band. This time they pushed their craft further by releasing the first of a Trilogy entitled ‘Brahmavidya: Primordial I’.  With this album RUDRA was perceived as a band that ever-evolved to become a reality far beyond comprehension. Till date the song ‘The Pathless Path to the Knowable Unknown’ of this album has become the Anthem of Vedic Metal. \r\n\r\n2009 saw the release of the second chapter of the Brahmavidya trilogy, ‘Brahmavidya: Transcendental I’. This was another masterpiece with longer songs and trance inducing interludes. Soon after this release, the band produced an epic video for the song ‘Hymns from the Blazing Chariot’ which was nominated for an award in the local film industry. \r\n\r\nIn 2010 RUDRA made another breakthrough by incorporating traditional and contemporary dance into their performance. This was staged at the Indian Arts Festival in 2010 with rousing reviews. \r\n\r\nThe phenomenal artistic achievement of a band hidden in the tropical forests of South East Asia has been missed by many but not the musicologists. Several papers have been published about RUDRA and Vedic Metal, making them a band for both metalheads and academics. \r\n\r\n2011 brought the final chapter of the Trilogy entitled ‘Brahmavidya: Immortal I’. The band is currently doing a world tour and planning to stage a full length Metal Dance fusion performance.\r\n','imran@apsara-asia.com.sg','http://www.facebook.com/RudraBand/info','http://www.rudraonline.org','','','0','5133',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','rudra'),(232,0,81,81,'Lucid Recess','Lucid Recess is an Alternative Metal band from Guwahati, Assam, India formed in April 2004 by brothers Siddharth and Amitabh.

If even one young adult says no to tobacco because they heard us, we’ll be justified in our cause.\r\n\r\nTough on Tobacco is Sidd Coutto’s first solo album.

The band was just featured in the Emmy-nominated hit television show “How I Met Your Mother”, NBC\'s \"Perfect Couples,\" and on the soundtrack for London Film Festival hit \"Today\'s Special.\" \r\n\r\nGoldspot has performed at the prestigious Glastonbury and iTunes festivals, and opened for several major acts including Death Cab for Cutie, Feist, Franz Ferdinand, Travis, and even Bon Jovi.  Their music videos have been featured on VH1 and MTV.\r\n\r\nThis album has lived in the mind of singer/songwriter Siddhartha Khosla since he was a child, growing up in his New Jersey home listening to Bollywood oldies and western rock bands.  “Western indie pop/rock sounds together with Bollywood inspired melodies and instrumentation just seems like a natural and wonderful musical partnership to me,” he says. “Mohd. Rafi, Michael Stipe of REM, Kishore Kumar, and The Beatles all have inspired me ever since I could sing my first note.”  Khosla formed the first incarnation of Goldspot eight years ago, and while he enjoys mixing the band up to play with different sounds and ideas, he remains the constant driving force, songwriter, and lead performer.     \r\n\r\n“And The Elephant is Dancing”  is the follow-up to Goldspot’s critically acclaimed full-length debut \"Tally Of The Yes Men\" (MERCURY UK/UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP), an inspired melding of decades of rock and pop influences with the melodic sensibilities of old Indian film music. \"Tally\" was recognized by the Sunday Times (UK) as one of the best albums of the year, with Goldspot being named as one of their best new acts of the year.   Hit single \"Friday\" put the band in the top 20 in the UK radio charts, and at No. 10 in the alternative charts.   Follow-up single, “It’s Getting Old” was awarded an iTunes Single of the Week slot and became the retailer’s largest free download in its history.  Goldspot\'s music has been featured multiple times on hit US TV shows “How I Met your Mother\", “The OC\" and several films, including the Simon Pegg hit \"Run Fatboy Run\", Rohan Sippy’s “The President is Coming”, and most recently in the soundtrack to “Today’s Special”.  \"Clap Clap\" appeared in Apple\'s video for the ipad.\r\n\r\n    \"One of the best bands to come out of America in years.\" -Sunday Times \r\n    \"Superbly Measured\" - Q \r\n    \"Subtle Sparkling Pop \" - Sunday Express\r\n    \"Sun drenched and beautifully melodic\" - The London Paper \r\n    \"Some of the most memorable vocal melodies heard in a long time.\" Popjournalism\r\n    \"Delirious and delicious\" - Vogue India\r\n\r\n              For more information:  www.goldspot.net, www.mypace.com/goldspot.

Everyone, except Ashwini from Orange Street and Rajat from Parikrama. They decided the show had to go on and brought in Indraneel, the bassist from Orange Street along with Sharat, Sonam and Gyan from Parikrama.\r\n\r\nThree days of intensive rehearsals - a combination of compositions - resulting in Ganga, Pahari Funk and Caravan - three songs that would give definition to what would become the sound of the band. The prerequisite of course, was a name - every band needs a name. Our local Archimedes, Neel, in a flash of inspiration in the shower (where else!) came up with \'Mrigaya\'. Mr. Kakkar, who incidentally won the spelling bee contest in his childhood (held only at Darya Ganj in the early 70s) mispelt it as \'Mrigya\' in one of the band profiles and the name stuck. \r\n\r\nThe show turned out to be a huge success which got them thinking of carrying on even though every member was a full time member of some band or the other at that particular time.\r\n\r\n18th Sept. 1999, IIT-DELHI, JAZZ NITE - A show - after which they realized a stronger rhythm section was needed.

At the time they barely knew the rudiments of instrumentation, and actually getting a band off the ground seemed like an unrealistic dream for the 16 year old school mates. But as time went on, there was a significant improvement, and at the beginning of 2004 the guys decided to take this more seriously after realizing the possible potential for a Metal Band in the Sri Lankan music industry, and the name \'Tantrum’ was born.\r\n\r\nThe band\'s style is considered Thrash Metal, with a touch of technical Death Metal with various melodic elements. Classical, Blues, Jazz & Eastern elements are also influential to the band when creating music.\r\n\r\nThe band recorded and released their first single titled “The Destroyer” which became a Number 1 hit on the local chart show (TNL’s SL Hot 10). This earned Tantrum some recognition in the metal scene. Soon afterwards, Tantrum released their 2nd single titled “Alone”, which proved that the band had great talent and it impressed many of the listeners, and so Tantrum had the fortune of starting off with two smash singles. Tantrum was also one of the few bands to take part in TNL Onstage (a battle of the bands like competition in Sri Lanka) for the 1st time & come out winners of the competition. This was in 2005. Tantrum then released an EP titled \"The Destruction Begins\" in 2006 and soon after the band went through a major line up change. Currently the line up is as follows -\r\n\r\n\r\nJaveen Soysa - Vocals & Bass Guitar\r\nAkila Pieris - Guitars\r\nThishan Wijesinghe - Guitars\r\nTharaka Senevirathne - Drums\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since the change the bands music evolved into genres stated above and the usage of crushing 7 string guitars became a unique and a first ever in Sri Lanka. Tantrum has also managed to appear in countless number of interviews, front covers of magazines and press articles etc, as well as electronic media around Asia and has been labeled as one of the leading Metal bands in Sri Lanka. The band cannot wait to get out there and delight the Metal World by providing them with dynamic music and performances to break their necks moshing to. Tantrum is looking forward to open the floodgates to a whole new level of music, and take Sri Lankan heavy metal to greater heights, and their journey has just begun.....','Tantrum Inc: (94) 777311698','http://www.facebook.com/tantrumental/info','http://www.tantrumental.com','','','0','4741',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','tantrum'),(241,2,1,1,'Middle Finger Theory','Middle Finger Theory is a NuMetal/Experimental act\r\nhailing from New Delhi, India brought into being in July of 2010.

Bjorn, the band’s front man and vocalist, started it off as a 4-piece college band, playing a very few covers and spurning out a couple of new songs. The line up, which at the time kept changing, saw the entry of Vikram (keyboardist) at an early stage. Soon after, Sajith and Shashank (bassist and drummer) stepped in to complete the picture. The latest addition to the band is Mervin Christopher (lead guitarist) who is ready and set to fill in the shoes of his predecessors. The band has yet another member - Frank. An alter-ego of the band, he writes all their songs for them. \r\n\r\nThe band has a simple principle which they stick to when making their music – It’s all about fun and love for the music based on situations and incidents which they’ve been through . In fact, the sole motivation for the band to record and release their music is to get the music out there to the people. The surging energy and the addictive songs the band churns out are complemented by the capturing stage presence and wacky costumes, which keeps audiences enraptured and jumping.  \r\n\r\nFGTF, as the band is popularly known, have won various competitions such as Deepwoods, Strawberry fields, NXG Rockstar , IIT Saarang and many more. After proving themselves in the inter-collegiate circle, the band progressed to playing professional gigs and live acts, headlining in different colleges.\r\nOnce the band had achieved all that they had aspired to, in the college foray, they decided to take it to the the Next Level. And that’s precisely what they did. The band’s first album was released in August 2011, aptly named the Next Level, to an overwhelming response from all quarters. An independent album, it was produced in Tobe’s Garage.\r\n\r\nThe band’s vision as far as the near future is concerned is to get their music out across the country and play professional gigs of all sorts.

Simply because, over the years, it has had many beginnings.  So may be it makes sense to start at the very beginning.\r\n\r\nLet me take you back to the time in the mid 90s when Neeraj and Jongky were wandering aimlessly around the streets of Tumkur as engineering students.   For the folks who do not know, Tumkur is a little town tucked away in the back of beyond.  Due to a serious lack of social life and also potential eye candy, they decided to engage themselves in something more serious and less frivolous than obtaining an engineering degree.  In time, they became a part of the college band which shot their stud status to dizzying heights – in Tumkur, that is.\r\n\r\nA few years later, a scrawny pimple faced teenager sauntered in to the same college.  The young and impressionable Ajit was captivated with the demigod status of Neeraj and Jongky.  He was determined, he wanted some of the action for himself.  Ajit went on to form a band of his own, and soon another band was thrown in the face of the hapless, unsuspecting engineering students of Tumkur.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately you can only take so many years to complete an engineering degree, however hard you try.  Four years later, they came out of college armed with an engineering degree in one hand and a guitar in the other.  It soon became obvious to them that the degree had more weight and thus music was put on the backburner for a while as they got busy in their respective jobs.\r\n\r\nSoon enough, to the shock and dismay of no one in particular, the monotony of a ‘regular job’ set in. And what else did they do but turn to music. This was the second beginning.  Martin an old friend from another engineering college in Tumkur (where else) joined the trio as vocalist.  A massive hunt for a drummer was launched via advertisements on the internet.  Elaborate auditions were planned for the anticipated response.Only one person queued up outside the house for the job.  Needless to say, he was selected. And thus,Vinay Raghavan aka Vinay,Vinnie,Rags made his grand entry and Sonic Flare was born.  This was 2002.\r\n\r\nThe band began jamming in Neeraj’s house regularly when Martin moved out of the city for professional reasons.  And you would think that this long story comes to an end here.  Alas!! No such joy.  Yet another beginning right here.  Vinay roped in Saurabh as the vocalist and in a few years time, the band carved a name and space for itself in Bangalore.  Things were finally falling in place when suddenly Saurabh decided to take a break from the band to pursue an MBA.   This was circa 2009.\r\n\r\nVinay, in the short span of five long years, had assumed the position of problem solver, manager, gig magnet, carpet duster and the like.  With his vast network, he was able to convince the young and effervescent Priyanka to join the band as a guest vocalist till the time that Saurabh got back.  Priyanka apart from hugely shifting the average age of the band to the right side of 30, managed to infuse a new freshness to the sound of the band. Soon enough, the band had a huge fan following and were performing in prime venues in Bangalore.  Rags soon roped in Nikhil as a vocalist to perform with the band.  Apart from further shifting the average age to the right side of 30, Nikhil brought in a new zest to the band.  Needless to say, Sonic Flare as it stands now is getting more and more popular with the crowds and the road ahead surely looks promising.\r\n\r\nYou would think that this long story would end here, right?

And with that in mind, 5 musicians came together to form a band that would echo the sound of music far and wide.\r\nDistortion culture was formed in the year 2009 as a progressive rock band by individuals who had different musical backgrounds from a guitarist who had a background in classical music to a novice drummer and bassist who had nothing in common at all except for their love for music. The band was thus formed with 5 members who’ve amalgamated their different styles and sounds into the energy-rich, power packed music that Distortion Culture is identified by. Having played in numerous college\r\nlevel competitions since the band’s inception, they’ve gathered a lot of appreciation and awe wherever they go. A melodic and progressive rock taste is what they\'ve come to be famous for. Some of the crowning moments in our journey so far has been winning IIM-B 2011, NIT Calicut 2010, finishing first runners-up at Cobalt Skies 2009 Bangalore Medical College, the very first competition the band took part in with the guitarist and bassist receiving a special mention by the judges of the event and the two maiden compositions, Unforeseen Truth and Mahaganapathim blowing the audience away, second runners-up at MCC, Ambedkar medical college, Christ university and being listed in top ten bands in NLS Strawberry fields 2010. There was no looking back from then onward with invitations to play at Palace Grounds, Strawberry Fields(NLS), The Kyra Theater, Yamaha Asia beats, Freedom Jam,\r\nLegends of Rock, My Opus radio , Fete De La Musique, Vh1 Media Nights and various other college events. A well blended feel of classical Indian music with the raw energy of\r\nprogressive metal is what the band is all about, with influences such as Dream Theater, Mr. Big, Liquid Tension Experiment, Animals as leaders, Porcupine Tree, Tool and Indian bands such as Motherjane and Avial, they have come out with a unique sound that identifies them as fresh and original in every sense.

They touch you, uplift you, rock you, get you to tap your feet, make you smile and reflect about things that were or may be. \r\n\r\nAirport had a successful launch in December 2009 at Del Italia, Mumbai. They played to a packed house of 250 + people. Since then, the band has played at several youth festivals and hang-outs, corporate events and live music venues across India. Airport recently played in the prestigious NH7 Festival in Pune, December 2010.\r\n\r\nAirport consists of Arijit Datta on vocals and guitar, Vinay Lobo on lead guitar, Amit Ahuja on bass, Zohran Miranda on rhythm guitar and Ashwin Andrews on drums.\r\n\r\n-bio written by the lovely Idea Smith','arijit.datta@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/thebandairport','http://www.myspace.com/thebandairport','http://soundcloud.com/airport-2','','172744261818','3558',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','airport'),(291,0,98,98,'La Abuela Disco','La Abuela Disco es una banda formada por Romny Freitez en la batería, Fuaz Kassen en la guitarra, Fauadz Kassen como vocalista y segunda guitarra, Eduardo Daza en el Teclado y Arnoldo Freitez en el bajo.\r\nInfluenciada por diversas corrientes musicales, como rock alternativo, post-grunge, electrónica e indie, esta banda nació a mediados del 2009 bajo la inquietud de hacer música alternativa y a su vez original, los integrantes se encargaron de reunir viejos amigos para concretar el proyecto musical logrando así presentarse en diversos festivales y locaciones del país.\r\nEn la actualidad la banda está en proceso de promocion de su primer album de estudio q lleva por nombre \"POLVO LUNAR\" Y salio a mediados del año 2011\r\n','Fauadz Kassen','http://www.facebook.com/pages/La-Abuela-Disco/112024625510278?sk=info','http://www.laabueladisco.com','http://soundcloud.com/laabueladisco','http://www.reverbnation.com/laabueladisco','0','3547',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','la-abuela-disco'),(292,0,0,0,'Hard Electric Tour','Hard Electric Tour is an alternative winter music festival tour in India under the rock umbrella genres of pop, punk, hardcore, emo etc etc... \r\n\r\nStarting this winter 2010 and the tour would become an annual event going forward.

They have been playing shows all over South Africa for the past few years with some of the country’s top acts, ranging from small intimate theatre shows to huge festivals.\r\n\r\n\"...almal wat ek ken wat die Gewere al sien rook het, reken dit is spiekeries.\" – litnet.co.za\r\n\r\nTheir style has been described as “gritty blues rock”, with influences ranging from early Robert Johnson era blues and Tom Waits to modern rock giants such as The White Stripes or Kings Of Leon.\r\n\r\n“What the Pretty Blue Guns do well, is introduce this genre of music to an audience that would not normally be familiar with it, back to a time when music was still considered an art. Not only do they introduce it, but they set the standard for others to follow.” -morethanmusic.co.za\r\n\r\nThey recently released an album entitled “Cutting Heads”, the name of which is a reference to blues buskers in the 1920’s that would battle for tips from passers-by, playing the same traditional blues songs as other buskers, except finding ways to make the songs more interesting and more entertaining in order to capture the attention and respect of the crowds. The album has been received with critical acclaim:\r\n\r\n“…‘n indrukkende debuut en ‘n sterk kandidaat vir die plaaslike rock-album van die jaar toekenning.” -Beeld (4/5 stars)\r\n\r\n“I can honestly say these guys, with the help of a brilliant producer and sound engineer have made an album that’s difficult to switch off once you started listening.” -samusicblog.co.za\r\n\r\n“…if you are a fan of any version of the blues, you will love Cutting Heads.” - twindie.net\r\n\r\n“…it’s a great album, I can almost describe the album as modern vintage, uniting the old and new into a complete package that is “Cutting Heads”. – morethanmusic.co.za\r\n\r\n“A fine, fine release from a shit-hot band. Highly recommended.” - Muse Magazine (4/5 Stars)\r\n\r\nThe Pretty Blue Guns do not follow the expectations of any particular \"scene\", and they have been praised for their heartfelt approach to the creation of music and their identity as a musical force that does not follow trends, but instead stays true to its roots. \r\n\r\nPick up you copy of \'Cutting Heads\' at the following stores:\r\n\r\nALL MUSICAS COUNTRY WIDE\r\nALL LOOK & LISTENS COUNTRY WIDE\r\nALL TOP CD\r\nALL PHASE 2\r\nALL MUSIC MOODS  STORES\r\n\r\nSUPER CD EASTRAND\r\nSUPER CD WESTGATE\r\nSUPER CD NELSPRUIT\r\nSUPER CD GLEN\r\n','lucavincenzo@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/prettyblueguns/info','http://www.prettyblueguns.co.za','http://soundcloud.com/prettyblueguns','','0','3530',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','the-pretty-blue-guns'),(294,0,3,3,'DJ Inferno','Welcome to DJ Inferno\'s Official Facebook Fan Page, You can find the latest mixsets , remixes, productions and gig updates.\r\n\r\nUpcoming Dates :\r\n\r\nNOV\r\n\r\n19/TBC\r\n04/BlueFrog (MUM)\r\n03/China House (MUM)\r\n\r\nOCT\r\n\r\n30/1Lounge (PUNE)\r\n29/BlueWaves (BLR)\r\n22/Private Party (BLR)\r\n16/Esko (BLR)\r\n14/O Bar (BLR)\r\n09/Esko (BLR)\r\n08/Private Party (BLR)\r\n\r\nSEP\r\n\r\n17/O2 Lounge (INDORE)\r\n4/TBC (GOA)\r\n3/Cafe Mambo (GOA)\r\n2/O Bar (BLR)\r\n\r\nAUG\r\n\r\n27/Private Party w/ Ma Faiza (BLR)\r\n26/O-BAR (BLR)\r\n20/Taj Mangalore + Paradise Isle Manipal\r\n\r\nJULY\r\n\r\n30/AMET Cruise Ship (CHE)\r\n29/BlueFrog (MUM)\r\n23/O2 Lounge (IND)\r\n22/NewsCafe (HYD)\r\n20/Pebble (BLR)\r\n17/Love Of Music Festival (BLR) \r\n15/Coco Bongo (BLR) \r\n13/Pebble (BLR)\r\n8/Coco Bongo (BLR)\r\n6/Pebble (BLR) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE\r\n\r\n24/O Bar (Bangalore)\r\n18/Club Zeus (Bangalore)\r\n17/O Bar (Bangalore)\r\n11/Dugout (Bangalore)\r\n10/O Bar (Bangalore)\r\n05/Tech Music Festival @ Chancery (Bangalore)\r\n04/Ibiza (Kolkata)\r\n03/The Basement (Kolkata)\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY\r\n\r\n27/O Bar (BLR)\r\n21/Base Music Festival @ Chancery (BLR)\r\n20/O Bar (BLR)\r\n15/SuperNova Festival(BLR)\r\n13/O Bar (BLR)\r\n06/Coco Bongo (BLR)\r\n\r\nAPR\r\n\r\n10/Fuga(BLR)\r\n16/Fluid(MYSORE)\r\n24/Stone Water Grill(PUNE)\r\n\r\n\r\nMAR\r\n\r\n2/Pebble(BLR)\r\n4/TBA (GOA)\r\n5/Club Ivy (GOA)\r\n10/Ujjan Festival (KOL)\r\n11/Ujjan Festival (KOL)\r\n12/Ujjan Festival (KOL)\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n\r\n5/Club Night Flight (MANGALORE) [DAY]\r\n5/Club Paradise Isle (MANIPAL) [NIGHT]\r\n18/Lava Lounge (GOA)\r\n21/Shiva Palace w/ Karan/Raol/Nitin/Earthling (GOA)\r\n\r\n\r\nJAN \r\n\r\n2/Zanzibar (GOA)\r\n7/Manchester Bar (BLR)\r\n20/Shiva Palace (GOA)\r\n21/Aurus w/ Paul Taylor (MUM)\r\n23/Pebble (BLR)\r\n\r\nDEC \r\n\r\n4/Pebble w/ BT (BLR)\r\n10/Plush (KOL)\r\n11/Pebble w/ UMEK (BLR)\r\n17/Firangi Pani (MUM)\r\n18/Oz Bar (DEL)\r\n24/Manchester United Bar (BLR)\r\n26/9Bar (GOA)\r\n27/Sunburn (GOA)\r\n31/Quorom (INDORE) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n:: BIOGRAPHY ::\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic was never an unfamiliar territory for DJ Inferno, born into a family that loved and appreciated music in 1984; he spent all his juvenile life listening to all forms of music. At an early age of 16 when kids around him were still caught in the boy band and pop revolution, Inferno was firmly making his roots in the music communities world wide with a burning desire to acquire more knowledge about the specific genres. In a quick span of 2 years he had a wealth of music that most people did not even know existed, propelling him further on underground online music sharing communities, he was much respected. This was the inclining step to a DJ Career that just began with residencies in pubs in the City and guest appearances with the city’s top DJs.\r\n\r\nAt a time when fresh house music was of the essence, Inferno was armed with some of the most exclusive and unreleased music that only a few could even dream about, unfortunately his immense talent only came into light when he was quickly identified and inducted in the Submerge Clan of DJs (www.submerge.in), an elite dance music promotion agency/community that only a select few are proud to be a part of, with international artists like Carl Cox, Ferry Corsten, Axwell, Copyright, Norman Doray and Indian artist like DJ Nikil Chinapa, Pearl, Nawed, Sanjay Dutta on their roster. Inferno was on the right path. \r\n\r\nRegular appearances at various clubs & venues across the country & outside was a part of Inferno’s roster, playing along side artists like DJ San (Fektive Recs, NL), Norman Doray & Arno Cost (Serial Recs, France), Copyright (Defected, UK) only pushed his skills beyond the comprehension of his peers. Performing on the same platform as these artists along with the biggest names in the Indian industry such as Jalabee Cartel, DJ Pearl, Nawed Khan, Sanjay Dutta etc Inferno was now standing on a solid foundation of musical knowledge, skill and experience, all this at an age of 23 adding to his belt a host of residencies across the city.\r\n\r\nDJ Inferno co-produces music under the moniker ‘Audio Units\', their music has been getting some lush feedback from the bigwigs in the industry. \r\n\r\nBeing called back to perform at every venue only speaks volumes about the vibe and experience his music provides to audience from all walks and venues of all sizes, be it uplifting progressive trance, to jacking minimal house or pounding techno and of course his signature style of music that you will probably hear months later, you can be sure to have a packed house in awe and appreciation of the music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n:: CLUB APPEARANCES ::\r\n\r\n- International -\r\n\r\n* NEPAL - Club Galaxy (Kathmandu)\r\n\r\n\r\n- National - \r\n\r\n* GOA - Sunburn 2010 / Sunburn 2009 / Sunburn Afterdark 2008 / Loungefly / Zanzibar / Mambos / 9 Bar / Club Ivy / Shiva Palace\r\n\r\n* MUMBAI - Squeeze / Bar 21 / Aurus / Firangi Paani / Tote / BlueFrog\r\n\r\n* COCHIN - Le Meredien\r\n\r\n* TRIVANDRUM - Twist\r\n\r\n* PUNE - Flags / 1Lounge / Gaia / Stone Water Grill\r\n\r\n* DELHI - Oz Bar / Ivyz\r\n\r\n* KOLKATA - Plush / Amoda / Basement\r\n\r\n* INDORE - Quorom / O2 Lounge\r\n\r\n* BANGALORE - Manchester United Bar (Current Resident) / Sutra / F-Bar / Nero / Blue Bar / Fuga / Pebble / Zero-G / Hint / Amnesia  & More\r\n\r\n:: DISCOGRAPHY ::\r\n\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/dj-inferno/\r\n\r\n','','http://www.facebook.com/DJ.Infern0/info','http://www.djinferno.in','','','0','3481',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','dj-inferno'),(295,0,100,100,'Boat Beam','La música de Boat Beam provoca. Provoca sentimientos y pensamientos, provoca miedo y emoción… Las canciones cambian tanto que es posible viajar por todas esas sensaciones al escuchar el disco o asistir a uno de sus conciertos.\r\n\r\nBoat Beam empezó hace poco en la vida de la australiana Josephine Ayling. Josephine tuvo un grupo (Terapin) con unos amigos del instituto, en Sydney, su ciudad natal. Incluso llegaron a publicar un EP que tuvo buenas críticas, pero ella tenía ganas de viajar y conocer mundo. Y eso es lo que hizo. Josephine viajó, conoció Perú, Bolivia, Brasil, India, Tailandia, Taiwán, y llegó a Londres y acabó haciendo lo inevitable: componiendo canciones. En Londres pasó un tiempo trabajando y viviendo en una casa con otros 12 extranjeros. Y allí supo cuál sería su siguiente paso. Quería aprender otro idioma y decidió que, como había aprendido algo de español en sus viajes, iría a España.\r\n\r\nJosephine llegó a Madrid en 2006 para aprender castellano y conocer más a fondo una cultura de la que sólo sabía los tópicos: toros, flamenco, siesta… Estuvo tres meses, pero le llamaron desde Australia para algo importante. Se unió a un grupo llamado Sparkadia y volvió a Londres, esta vez para grabar un disco producido por Ben Hillier (productor del Think Tank, de Blur, entre muchos otros). Durante 2007 estuvo de gira por Australia e Inglaterra, Sparkadia actuaba abriendo para bandas como Elbow y The Thrills y poco a poco se iba asentando. Pero a finales de año, Josephine suspiraba por volver a España. A comienzos de 2008, se instaló en Madrid.\r\n\r\nVino con un disco grabado a medias, entre giras y con varios colaboradores, en un estudio de Sydney. Y en Madrid siguió grabando mientras hacía conciertos como solista. Un día conoció Alisha, una americana que había tocado la viola en grupos de música clásica, jazz, y rock. Se juntaron para probar las canciones con guitarra y viola y ¡sonaban muy bien! Empezaron a tocar juntas y en uno de esos conciertos conocieron a Aurora, una chelista que había tocado en varios proyectos en Madrid. Aurora llevaba tiempo con la idea de formar un grupo con gente con la que congeniara tanto en el plano musical como en el personal y por fin la había encontrado. Así nació Boat Beam. Alisha y Aurora añadieron sus instrumentos al disco que tenía a medias Josephine y entre todas decidieron incorporar otros elementos como teclados y coros. Finalmente, acabaron la grabación en septiembre.\r\n\r\nSus influencias musicales son muy variadas, desde Cinematic Orchestra y Jóhann Jóhannson, hasta Pink Martini, Lhasa, the Dresden Dolls, The Shins, Supergrass, The Pixies, Sonic Youth, y Why? Les encantan Fiona Apple y Juana Molina pero también la música clásica de Satie y Debussy… Muchas ideas surgen de libros, de escritores como Herman Hesse, Michael Ende, Patrick Süskind, Ian McEwan, Juan Rulfo, Jonathan Franzen, Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, John Irving, Louis De Bernières y muchos más. Las tres están unidas por algo más que la música. Les interesa la ecología y los asuntos que afectan el mundo. Les gusta viajar, leer, vivir. Y todo lo que aprenden y comparten acaba formando parte de las canciones. Esas canciones que provocan sentimientos, pensamientos, miedo, emoción… Esas canciones que no te dejarán indiferente.','miguel@arigatocomunicacion.com','http://www.facebook.com/boatbeammusic/info','','','','0','3471',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','boat-beam'),(296,0,31,31,'Vhumi','Vhumi (June 14, 2008)\r\n\r\nTRACK LIST:\r\n1.

Arun (ex Extinct Reflections), Vibhas( ex Spitfire), Ashish( ex Inner Sanctum, Spit) and Nikhil( ex Asylum). Having played with their previous bands for quite a while, the quartet aimed at composing songs which were inspired by various forms of music with no particular bias towards any genre/sub genre. While maintaining progressive metal as their prime focus, the band composes songs combining elements from jazz, fusion and ambient resulting in an unconventional musical concoction. \r\n\r\n The band gained respect and popularity in the local scene at quiet an early stage for their ability to engage their audiences and appeal to their intellectual side through the band’s live performances. In March 2009, the band released their debut EP titled “The Sculptor of Negative Emotions\" at Bangalore\'s premier \"All Original Music Fest\" – Rock Ethos. The band’s intention to deliver a package of high artistic value lead to stunning cover art by American artist Alex Eckman Lawn. The EP saw buyers across the Indian Subcontinent and some parts of Europe and America. \r\n\r\n In August 2009, the band welcomed Faheem as their lead guitarist to help extend its musical boundaries into unmapped metal territories. Thus adding another dimension to the band’s sound. In September 2010, Arjun replaced Ashish on guitars as the latter fled to France for his higher education. \r\n\r\n Highlights of the band include winning and headlining at various college festivals and also sharing the stage with metal heavy weights such as Meshuggah, Textures, Amon Amarth, Tesseract, Enslaved and a host of killer Indian bands.\r\n\r\n In August 2011, the band represented India in the Wacken Metal Battle at W:O:A in Germany and were very well received by their international audience.  \r\nFull video for your viewing pleasure here (http://media.ndr.de/progressive/2011/0811/TV-20110811-1112-3901.hq.mp4)\r\n\r\n Currently, the band has finished writing and recording their full length debut album - \'Winding the Optics\' which is aimed at a September 2011 release. The album contains over 45 min of progressive metal written over a span of 2 years.\r\n\r\n\"If you like your metal equal parts modern and old school, be sure to check out the amazing Eccentric Pendulum - sinister progressions, vicious thrash riffs, carefully calculated prog, sweetly crafted melodies topped off with soaring guitar solos make this a powerful and intricate album you want to sit down with and chew over for a long time.

They were also one of the four bands chosen to record with world - renowned producer John Leckie as a part of the British Council’s Soundpad. As a part of the Soundpad project the band went on a 2 - week tour of the United Kingdom; playing at festivals and venues such as ‘The Great Escape festival, Brighton’ and ‘the Barfly’.

First was an idea, then was the searching and in the end, the meeting. It was between two guys, one with the spirit and the other with the voice and more. After tones of discussions and more than 60 names, Blue Nipple Boy was the one and so will remain. We needed a special invitation to see the light and we’ve got it the summer of 2010. This was the birth of Special Invitation – first single ever. \r\n\r\nFirst audition on a radio was at City FM, a Romanian rock station where Special Invitation smiled in charts for five weeks.\r\n\r\nThe next release was one of the catchiest and is called Womanman, due to its vibe and story, way too spicy and undefined. Womanman conquered few national radio stations, but has found its no.1 position in Radio Guerrilla’s Chart for weeks. It was the second most rated and voted single of 2011 by Guerrilla’s listeners.    \r\n\r\nAlong with the third member – the percussionist Balasa Gabriel, we had the stage debut in March 2011 at Control Club, Bucharest. It was a trio based concert with a lot good energy and fun. After few weeks, the bass/contra-bass player, Adi Neacsu, joined the band and so, the next single was released. Bear Comes Naked is a simple, chill and positive combination of acoustics and it was self recorded and released in 2011. The official video for Bear Comes Naked was released at National Television on June 3, 2011. This single was elected to be part of what is called Music Alliance Pact, an international music compilation comprising songs from 36 countries. Bear represented Romania in May 2011 and became no. 1 in charts, as Womanman did it before. \r\n\r\nAfter Alexandru Alexe (drums) and Luis Angel Palomino (sax & flute) joined the band in 2011, we have recorded and released the next single, Salta Montes, a combination of oriental, rock and disco music. \r\n\r\nThe band gained a lot of experience as a group of 6 members and was invited to join the largest festivals and concerts in Romania, like Peninsula Felsziget Festival, B’ESTFEST, Street Heroes Festival, Street Delivery Festival and many more. At Peninsula Felsziget we have gained our participation at Sziget 2012, which is considered the best major festival in Europe.  \r\n   \r\nThe newest single it is called Hot and is a cover version of INNA – Hot. With a bossa-nova vibe, we believe we have turned the original tune in a different one, so that a new blue song has been released. \r\n\r\nThe debut album is on the road and we hope that in the Spring of 2012 you will be able to listen it in every possible place and mood. Once you will listen it you will discover a very fusion album, mixing pop, rock, bossa, rap, punk, latino, oriental, folklore, disco, 8bit sounds and more. \r\n','PR Aleka Sarah Vladareanu, phone: +40727820314 email: aleka.sarah@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Blue-Nipple-Boy/135484266491040?sk=info','','http://soundcloud.com/bluenippleboy','http://www.reverbnation.com/bluenippleboy','0','3283',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','blue-nipple-boy'),(304,0,1,1,'Kailasa','','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Kailasa/109603329058565','','','','109603329058565','3272',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','kailasa'),(305,0,4,4,'Ashwamedh','Redefining the boundaries of Hindi Rock and defining an unprecedented sound for the masses, was the sole aim with which ‘Ashwamedh’ was formed.\r\n \r\nBringing home a heady mix of Indian Classical, Funk, Hard Rock and Metal, we choose not to restrict ourselves to any particular genre.\r\n\r\nWith groovy yet powerful originals, laden with inspiring lyrics and vocals, crushing riffs, monster leads and drumming work, Ashwamedh has always had the crowd hungry for more in it\'s wake...\r\n\r\nShattered pre-defined notions about Hindi Rock are a collateral, for which we take full responsibility :-P\r\n\r\nThe name \'Ashwamedh\' has been derived from the ancient custom of \'Ashwamedh Yagna\' where the sacred horse runs to the limits to determine the boundaries of the king\'s newly acquired kingdom.\r\nSimilarly, with a rabidly increasing and fiercely loyal fan following, we believe our music is the emperor and we shall serve by defining newer boundaries for it!\r\n\r\nThe first two original \'Qaid\' and \'Aelaan\' are up for listening here:\r\n    www.reverbnation.com/ashwamedh\r\n\r\nNews n Gigs :\r\n   \r\n    *Won the Silver for India in the Best Rock Song category at the the Indiego Music Awards 2011-2012, Asia\'s Biggest Music Awards.\r\n\r\n   * Nominated in the Best Rock Song category at the BiteMyMusic Global Music Awards 2012, world\'s one of the biggest music awards.\r\n\r\n   * Only Asian band to be globally shortlisted for Sweden Rock festival 2012.\r\n  \r\n    * Headlined at Chaos 2012, the annual fest of IIM Ahmedabad.\r\n\r\n    * Headlined at Aurora 2012, the annual fest of IIITM Gwalior.\r\n\r\n    * Headlined at Taksh 2012, the annual festival of IIT Rajasthan.\r\n\r\n    * Headlined at Elan 2012 the annual festival of IIT Hyderabad.\r\n\r\n    * Co-headlined with Indus Creed at EOS 2012, Mumbai.\r\n\r\n    * Headlined at Trascend 2012, the annual festival of Symbiosis Institute of Business Management, Pune.\r\n\r\n    * Headlined MADMA 2012, annual festival of Xavier\'s Institute Communication.\r\n\r\n    * Headlined at Zest 2012 the annual sports festival of College of Engineering Pune.\r\n\r\n    * Co-Headlined with Agnee at Creo 2011, annual fest of F.L.A.M.E School of Management Pune.\r\n\r\n    * Headlined at Vidyut 2011, RV College of Engineering, Bangalore.\r\n\r\n    * Featured by Jaago Mumbai 90.8 FM for their show Desi Trax.\r\n\r\n    * Headlined Blizzard - Rock Festival 2011, Pune.\r\n\r\n    * Headlined at Surge 2011, Annual Festival of NIT Kurukshetra.\r\n\r\n    * Headlined at Fundamental 2011, Annual Festival of Symboisis Institute for Design, Pune.\r\n   \r\n    *Performed at the grand Finale of Channel [V] Launchpad at IndiaFest, Goa. \r\n\r\n   *Headlined at the MTV Rock On Desi Beats 2 Promo Gig at the Bandra Amphitheater,Mumbai.\r\n \r\n   *Co-headlined with  Motherjane at NITIE,Mumbai,for their rock concert \'Decibelz\' 2010.\r\n      \r\n   *Performed at Rockforte 2010 Pune.\r\n \r\n   * Covered by BigM magazine for their October 2010 issue.\r\n\r\n   * Covered by Society magazine for their August 2010 issue.\r\n\r\n   * Headlined at \"Forza 2010\",at ISBM,Pune,at their Foundation Day festival.\r\n\r\n   * Performed at Soccer Mania 2010 Pune.\r\n\r\n   * Headlined at “Palm Expo 2010”, India\'s only Internationally reputed Musicians Expo. \r\n\r\n    * Performed at \"Rude Lounge\", Mumbai\r\n\r\n    * Featured by Indian Music Revolution as their \"In Focus\"  band.\r\n\r\n    * Headlined at “Surge 2010” at the K.J Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai.\r\n\r\n    * Co-Headlined ISB&M\'s fest Crescendo 2010 along with Bollywood sensation \"Javed Ali\".\r\n\r\n    * Headlined Cummins Women\'s College of Engineering annual fest \"Gandhaar \'10\".\r\n\r\n    * Headlining act @ (Symbiosis Institute of Telecom Management) SITM\'s college fest \"Inferno\'10\".\r\n    \r\n    * Covered by Radio Mirchi for Mirchi Soundcheck.\r\n\r\n    * Performed at Doolally Microbrewery,1st Brewhouse, Corinthians...

What makes them different is their approach to music as it is targeted both at musicians and the common ear. Their first album* “Between and Beyond” is a product of their unique intuitive style of songwriting. “Between and Beyond” speaks about the multi-universes, physical and meta-physical, things we see and yearn to see, and about the many lives and personalities inherent in us all, and about how our lives are connected in our choices and experiences resulting from them.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the band’s 8 year history, they were known for their near perfect covers. Evergreen grew from a commercial/corporate circuit to the rockers they are today.\r\n\r\nThey give special attention in selecting their equipment, emphasizing on creating a sound of their own. Their national experience won them many accolades, making them a formidable opponent in any nation-wide competition and an elemental sounding band waiting to unleash.\r\n\r\nIn the soundscapes and imagery of Evergreen, there is an apparent \"guardian\" theme, be it of nature, innocence or against ignorance. These messages are obvious in their song Run to the Light and contextualized in From Here to Clarity. These songs not only offer the premise but also the irony. Thus they had made a stand against issues like Global Warming and Cruelty Against Animals, not by being preachy but choosing the Post-Modern path.','evergreenrocks@gmail.com           ','http://www.facebook.com/EvergreenIndia/info','http://www.evergreenrocks.com','','http://www.reverbnation.com/evergreen','0','3231',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','evergreen'),(309,0,63,63,'Street Stories','Street Stories are an indie, pop-punk band from Shillong, India. Street Stories have recently been performing at the various competitions besides a couple of high profile pro gigs that have taken place in the region. With a serious desire to make music their form of release the lads have big plans for the future\r\n\r\n\r\n Consisting of Pezo Kronu, Riko Kronu and Matsram Sangma, the band was officially formed on the outset of last year’s winter that is January, 2010. The band is well known for their spirit of playing full on high energy concerts and they have already made quite an impression at all the gigs they have played at.\r\n\r\nThe band was founded by the two brothers Riko and Pezo. And the two say that they have been breathing and talking music ever since they were toddlers, “Initially as we grew up, our minds expanded and we had the desire to get on further with our musical adventure and that was when we finally decided to form a band. Although, at first it was just the two of us and a friend who seasoned as a drummer but eventually left due to personal reasons. Nonetheless, this never blocked our way from building up our musical careers, we moved on forward with what we do best i.e. making music. Finally, a year later we met our current and permanent drummer, at our local church (Shillong Baptist Church) where we first played together, then we came to realize that he had potential and not only that but he also had the same common ideas, concepts as we did too when it comes to playing live. So basically Church singing has brought the band together and that’s how it happened.”\r\n\r\nThe band does not have any contradicting ideas or music to implement it on the sound of the band because they are all open to all sorts of musical genres and their taste of music is extensively varied. The band believes that tunes are tunes regardless of genres and that any song with catchy tunes and strong melodies are the key ingredients to a good song. The main influence these guys have in common would be the desire and love that they share towards making music and getting it on recordings/tapes for all their listeners and also for themselves and playing them live. \r\n\r\n“The Apple & the Clown” is the title of the bands debut EP. The album is a product of five songs spanning for about 20 minutes from start till end. However, the album is still in its shell awaiting to be released. “The Apple & the Clown” is inspired by the relationship of the lead singer (Pezo) and his girlfriend. The “Apple” is referred to his girlfriend while he refers to himself as the “Clown”. It’s a rare thing perhaps, when considering of making it a theme for a debut production.\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you for reading :)\r\n\r\n',' springboardbands@gmail.com, <span class=\"skype_pnh_print_container_1342002799\">+919436119961</span><span class=\"skype_pnh_container\" dir=\"ltr\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"skype_pnh_mark\"> begin_of_the','http://www.facebook.com/streetstoriesband/info','','http://soundcloud.com/streetstories','','0','3193',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','street-stories'),(310,0,104,104,'Skrypt','KRYPT is a 5 piece Thrash metal band from Hyderabad.

Como si el mal no hubiera sido expulsado del paraíso, sino que se hubiera ido por elección propia.\r\n\r\nLuego de sembrar el camino por donde se movería la banda con estos singles y algunas presentaciones en vivo entre finales del 2009 y principios del 2010, la banda se internó en los estudios de Mundano Records entre noviembre 2009 y febrero 2010, y plasmó 12 estupendos temas en su primera placa, bajo el título de Fuego Negro, álbum debut que resume en perfecta conjunción las influencias y estilos de sus integrantes en una demoledora máquina que avanza por los caminos del rock alternativo.\r\n\r\nFuego Negro fue lanzado en Agosto 2010 vía Mundano Records, y se viene presentando en vivo en varios shows iniciales, en los que se puede encontrar el álbum a precios especiales. \r\n\r\nEscucha muestras del album \"Fuego Negro\" y hazle download a los singles \"Libélula\" y \"Fuego Negro\" en alta calidad, dale click a la flechita al lado derecho de cada tema en el player:\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/mundanorecords/sets/kuraka-fuego-negro-album-samples\r\n\r\nCONTACTO\r\nmundanorecords@gmail.com\r\n98137*8005\r\n99400*3734\r\n\r\nCD \"FUEGO NEGRO\" DE VENTA EN:\r\nTiendas de la cadena Phantom, Two Music de Larcomar, Vía Music de Av.

The name \'Odyssey\' was chosen because it signified a long musical journey that the band felt like it was embarking on. Odyssey is also the name of a very famous poem based on Greek mythology, which are elements that can be found in Odyssey\'s original music as well.\r\n\r\nAfter trying out a couple of vocalists, the band was introduced to Raja Nabeel Banwa who was a big fan of progressive music as well. As it turns out, he could play keyboards too, so after meeting up with him, the band chose him as their vocalist and keyboard player. The band also recruited Fawad Nadir for playing bass for them at live gigs, but after producing their 1st album with the help of a close friend Ahmed Waqar, they invited Ahmed to join as a bass player in the band. Also knowing that Ahmed is an extremely talented guitar player as well, Odyssey were not surprised to see him become a beast on that 6-Stringed Ibanez Bass.\r\n\r\nSadly, after being in the band for around a year, producing Odyssey\'s 2nd album called \"Crossroads to Oblivion\" and more importantly getting an admission in the prestigious Berklee College of Music, Boston, Ahmed Waqar had to leave Odyssey to pursue his own academic and musical career.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 2011, during their hunt for their next bass guitarist, Odyssey were introduced to Haider Abbas who had been a prominent member of the Lahore Underground Scene since a couple of years. They were really impressed by his playing and hence he was asked to join the band.\r\n\r\nSo far Odyssey has written 2 original albums, played at numerous gigs in Lahore & Islamabad, given interviews for different T.V/Radio shows and documentaries which has developed a strong fanbase for the band in the local scene.\r\n\r\nOdyssey\'s music is inspired by bands like Dream Theater, Symphony X, Metallica, Megadeth, Black Sabbath, Pantera, Savatage, Ark, Opeth and Liquid Tension Experiment amongst others','+923214314321 - You can also email at odysseypakistan@gmail.com, hussam.raza@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/odysseypk/info','','http://soundcloud.com/odysseypk\n','http://www.reverbnation.com/odysseyprog','0','3011',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','odyssey'),(316,0,106,106,'Alobo Naga & the Band','BAND BIO\r\n\r\nGenre: Contemporary Progressive Rock.\r\n\r\nBand members:\r\n\r\nAlobo Naga- Vocals, Guitar, Piano, Bamhum\r\n\r\nAkum Jams- Guitar/Ukulele/vocals\r\n\r\nFung Walling- Bass/vocals\r\n\r\nDJ Sumika Yepthomi- Turntable / Guitar/vocals\r\n\r\n\r\nBAND PROFILE:\r\n\r\n\'Alobo Naga and the band\' is made up of five very ordinary and typical young Naga men.\r\nNagaland has the reputation of being perhaps the most musical state in India. And considering the fact that India itself is a virtual treasure of musical styles and traditions that\'s no mean feat! Dimapur, the town where the band originates, has been at the center of the musical revolution which has been progressively overtaking the state. From Bach and Beethoven to the Black Eyed Peas and Maroon 5\'s \'Moves like Jagger\', Nagaland is no stranger to any genre you can think of. \'Alobo Naga and the band\' by establishing themselves as heavyweights in this environment of musical explosion has earned their stripes. After all the critics here are as unforgiving as they come! Formed in 2010 they have been making more and more noise, of the good kind of course. While their roots are firmly entrenched in the contemporary progressive rock genre, they nevertheless appreciate and are quick to incorporate from any other genre.\r\n\r\nALOBO NAGA\r\n\r\nThe main Vocalist of the group, Alobo Naga holds a grade 8 certificate in Concert performance in Contemporary Vocals, from Rock School under Trinity School of Music, London. Prior to the band\'s formation, Alobo was already an established pop musician, He is at ranked at 6th spot nationwide at Gospel/Christian music on www.Reverbnation.com, besides being a performing artist & a composer, he is also a music teacher at the Furtados School of music, one of the premiere institutes of the country.\r\n\r\nRecently he won the Best Folk Fusion song Award in the Nagaland Music Award 2011 for his song \"Kumsujulo\" from his Solo debut album. It is interesting to note that while Alobo might be considered the main vocalist of the band, the other members themselves are formidable singers and frequently lend their vocals to the songs.\r\n\r\n\r\nAKUM JAMS\r\n\r\nAkum is the lead guitarist of the band. Formerly with the much lauded band \'Melodrama\', Akum was featured by \'TNT\' magazine as one of the gen next guitarists from the north east. The man himself bears a striking resemblance to the bad boys of western music with his tattoos and a very \'Rolling Stone\'ish\' vibe. However, his band mates will tell you that he is far from being the juvenile bad boy.\r\n\r\nFUNG WALLING\r\n\r\nThe Bass maestro of the band Fung is diminutive and soft spoken, yet morphs into a performing machine on stage. Before the band happened he was a member of the successful Christian band \'Blended For Him\'. He works at \'Furtado\'s music Dimapur\'.\r\n\r\nSUMIKA\r\n\r\nDJ Sumika, as he is popularly known, brings the club to the band! A Turntablist with the meanest skills, he most definitely adds chutzpah! to the band\'s music. With his added mix the band\'s music very audibly reaches into the playing fields of international bands like \'Linkin Park\' and \'Incubus\'. He also teaches music at \'Furtado\'s\'.\r\n\r\nNOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS\r\n\r\nAlobo Naga & The Band’s song ‘Painted Dreams’ was selected as the Theme Song of the prestigious International Short Film Festival 2011 –Guwahati. The song \"Painted Dreams\" went up to No.4 at International Top 10 chart at VH1, and was successively pronounced one of the top 50 videos of 2011 by the same channel. \r\n\r\nAt the Nagaland Music awards 2011 the band won honors including, \"Best Rock song\" for \'Painted Dreams\',  \"Best Producer\" and \"Best Mixing\" .\r\n\r\nThe band is ranked at the 9th spot nationwide on www.Reverbnation.com\r\n\r\nThe band has performed tracks for a Bollywood movie \'Beyond\' under Golden Eye production and is also working on other movies.\r\n\r\nPlayed at FREE BIRD festival, W.O.R.M.E fest , KINX, Taj Deccan ...\r\n\r\n\r\nManager – Prithish Chakroborty & Betoka Swu\r\n Find us @ www.Facebook@alobonagaandtheband\r\n website : www.alobonaga.com\r\n For booking @ booking@alobonaga.com\r\n','+91 9615 1025 45','http://www.facebook.com/alobonagaandtheband/info','http://www.alobonaga.com','http://soundcloud.com/alobo-naga','','0','2980',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','alobo-naga-the-band'),(317,0,2,2,'Coshish','Fusing elements of Progressive Rock, with the more easily acceptable mainstream song writing styles of Hindi Rock, seems to come naturally to Mumbai based band Coshish.

As the band’s sound evolved over the course of the next 18 months, Christophe Szpajdel (Emperor, Enthoned) was approached to design a suitable logo reflecting the band\'s music visually. The band underwent several personnel changes until a stable and committed line-up was completed with the recruitment of Aleksej Obradovic (bass) and Shoi Sen (guitar), with David Andrews stepping in to play the drums on the recording. In April 2007, De Profundis recorded its first album, entitled ‘Beyond Redemption’, which was mixed by Steve Watkins at Warehouse Studios, Oxford and mastered by Tim Turan at Turan Audio (Dimmu Borgir, Opeth, Emperor). Achilleas Gatsopoulos (Dark Tranquillity, Arcturus) created the artwork for the album. ‘Beyond Redemption’ self-released in August 2007.\r\n\r\nDelivering unique-sounding progressive extreme metal, De Profundis has many genre-bridging elements to their sound spanning across death, black and doom metal right through to jazz and progressive rock. These draw on a wide range of influences and the diverse nationalities of the band members. Having played their first show in September 2007 with drummer Sterghios Moschos, De Profundis has been delivering high impact live performances to rave reviews and enthusiastic crowds, being voted the 6th Best Unsigned Band in the 2007 Terrorizer Readers\' Poll. \r\n\r\nFollowing further glowing reviews, De Profundis was invited to perform at the MMD Festival in Athens (Greece) in March 2008. Upon returning from Greece, the band supported the French band Misanthrope on both of their exclusive UK shows. In July 2008, Nick Tingle replaced Sterghios Moschos, making his live debut with De Profundis at Bloodstock Open Air 2008 Festival. In December 2008, De Profundis was handpicked by Zero Tolerance magazine to take part in their showcase \"Day of Unrest\" gig. \r\n\r\nIn February 2009, De Profundis supported Iron Maiden at the Rock in India Festival in Bangalore, India in front of 20,000 people. On the back of this performance, Sony BMG gave the band a record deal to release their debut album \"Beyond Redemption\" in India. \r\n\r\nWith De Profundis now putting all their effort on completing their sophomore album, growing musical differences resulted in Aleksej Obradovic departing from the band and being replaced by Arran McSporran in May 2009. \r\n\r\nIn the months of June and July 2009, De Profundis recorded their second album \"A Bleak Reflection\" with producer Fernando Pereira Lopes (Misanthrope, Orakle). The album was once again mastered by none-other-than Tim Turan at Turan Audio. Darryll Jones created the album\'s artwork. \r\n\r\nAugust 2009 saw the band resuming its intensive live schedule with a show in Bucharest (Romania) and an appearance at Portugal’s Festival Ilha do Ermal 2009. In Autumn 2009, De Profundis performed in Paris (France) and toured across Northern England and Scotland. \r\n\r\nFollowing the European release of album \"A Bleak Reflection\" on Kolony Records in February 2010, De Profundis officially launched the new album with a show at the Underworld, London. The band returned to play at the Underworld several weeks later for the “Infernal Damnation VI” festival. In May 2010, De Profundis undertook a two-week European tour with Ragnarok (Norway) and Noctem (Spain), performing in Germany, Austria, Poland, Holland and Belgium. \r\n\r\nFollowing the European release of \"A Bleak Reflection\" several months earlier, De Profundis signed with Relapse Records for exclusive distribution in USA and Canada. Following the success of the band’s first album, Sony BMG released “A Bleak Reflection” in India in June 2010. With the support of the British Council, De Profundis returned to India on a headlining tour in October 2010, which included co-headlining Kingfisher’s Octoberfest 2010 in Bangalore in front of 30,000 alongside Lacuna Coil.\r\n\r\nIn April / May 2011, De Profundis went on a 14-date European tour with Rotting Christ and Omnium Gatherum, performing in 11 countries across Central and Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe third De Profundis album \'The Emptiness Within\' will be released in May 2012.\r\n\r\nRead more: http://www.deprofundistheband.com','wietze@armadaagency.com','http://www.facebook.com/deprofundistheband/info','http://www.deprofundistheband.com','','','0','2963',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','de-profundis'),(323,0,0,0,'Aux Raus','','','http://www.facebook.com/auxraus/info','http://www.auxraus.com','','','0','2962',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','aux-raus'),(324,0,3,3,'Theorized','Theorized is a Thrash Metal outfit from Bangalore, India.

Hamza\'s diverse international sound is influenced from his strong musical background as well as growing up in India and traveling the world, living in Paris, Boston, and New York. Exposure to renowned house DJs such as Terry Francis, Dave Mothersole, DJ Heather, and Danny Teneglia inspired Hamza to create his own electronic dance productions. Soon he found a unique style of house music combining deep, tribal, and funky sounds with strong world music influences.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 27 Hamza has already worked with some of the biggest names in world music. These artists include Punjabi icon Jasbir Jassi and David Hykes, the only western vocalist specializing in sacred Mongolian chants. Besides these artists, Hamza has also worked with Taz from Stereo Nation, the largest selling Indian pop fusion act ever. \r\n\r\nTo further nourish this growing production repertoire, Hamza has set up his own label Wind Horse Records. While in New York, Hamza did his Masters in Music Business at New York University, which gave him a very strong foundation and insight into how to creatively promote his own music. Wind Horse Records, the first Indian house music label, is a major part of that vision. Hamza has recently launched the label with his own Sufi Soul EP, containing three original world music influenced house music jewels. The Sufi Soul EP\'s vibrant, tribal sound earned the notice and accolades of many new fans including Dubfire (Deep Dish), Peter Kruder (Kruder & Dorfmeister), Richie Hawtin, Quentin Harris, and Tom Findlay (Groove Armada).\r\n\r\nHamza is also a top notch DJ, bringing his fresh sound to dancefloors from New York to Portugal, Boston to Hyderabad, Paris to Pune. His sets typically start with his signature deep house sound, heavily influenced by Latin/Afro/World flavors, before developing into powerful tribal and deep, tech-house influenced beats perfect for the peak time. Hamza\'s unmistakable style, combined with many of his own productions, create memorable DJ sets that turn many clubbers into instant fans and followers.\r\n\r\nCurrently Hamza is working on expanding his base in New Delhi to include regular stays in Europe and North America to allow for global partnerships and yearly DJ tours in different parts of the world. His vision is unstoppable, as Hamza has recently formed two different live acts with two different percussionists: Jasu Khan, a famous Rajasthani percussionist, and Manu Idhra, a Portuguese master of dance music percussion. Hamza has already taken this act on the festival circuit with an acclaimed performance at the Elektron Festival in Switzerland with percussionist Latif Khan playing Morchang and Khartal. Future performances will include even more musicians as well as dancers creating a truly unique performance atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs for Wind Horse Records, a dozen releases have appeared thus far and the label’s world-wide audience is growing considerably. An EP recorded with David Hykes has been released, as well as Hamza EPs featuring fantastic world music artists such as Yungchen Lhamo of Real World Records and female Indian classical maestro Sunanda Sharma. Wind Horse will also be including remixes from highly regarded producers from the west like Presslaboys and Amit Shoham. In addition, Hamza has started working with labels outside of Wind Horse, contributing tracks and remixes for the likes of Kompakt, Open Bar, One Thirty, and Clubstar. To help people keep up with all this musical activity Hamza has launched the WHR Podcast Series which will feature a monthly mix from the headquarters of Wind Horse Records.\r\n\r\nHamza has established himself as one to keep a close eye on in the house music scene. With his impressive list of past and upcoming projects as well as fiery worldwide DJ performances Hamza is quickly becoming an important and influential talent in his own right. Through Wind Horse Records and his inventive east-west fusions Hamza is working to bring the world closer to his listeners, one beat at a time.','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/DJ-HAMZA/29866618780?sk=info','http://www.djhamza.com','','','0','2927',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','dj-hamza'),(326,0,22,22,'B.R.E.E.D','After the first track released by B.R.E.E.D landed directly in the Top Ten Beatport Dubstep Charts in 2010, the road was thereby soundly paved for this matured identity. B.R.E.E.D\'s colorfully-raw avenues have become the foundations for his evolving production and musical promenade with his upcoming releases featuring heavily-layered bass lines and exquisitely original intonations.  \r\n\r\nShortly after the Top Ten Dubstep success, B.R.E.E.D released an EP on High Chai Recordings called \"Sound Killer,\" of which both tracks appeared in the Beatport dubstep charts yet again!  But this notable activity was induced by layers of exploration and intellectual evolution. Previously, under his initial name, DJ Nasha, this self-manufactured artist claimed the World DMC Championship (India) in 1999 and 2000, of which he appeared for the finals of in New York and London.   He then capitalized on this energetic snowball of creation and consequently changed the musical horizon in his homeland of India. Recently labeled on MistaJam\'s BBC Radio One Program as the \"dubstep ambassador of India,\" B.R.E.E.D has evolved his musical disposition from an exclusively self-trained DJ and producer from Bombay India, to an artist who has now played alongside internationally-recognized personalities like Cold Cut, Freq Nasty, Caspa, and Howie B.

We found a drummer in Saurav who had to leave a year later. The search for a good metal drummer finally led Joy switching onto Drums. Vivek (Guitars) and Rahul (Vocals) who were close friends of the band joined in and the new line-up started playing live around town.\r\n\r\nLyrically, the themes are as diverse as: Motivating ourselves about not laying low and emotionally depressed without necessity (Why So Emo?), to releasing the rage and hatred in a constructive way (Burn In Peace). From somehow digesting the happenings of the corrupt and unfair (Resistance) to speaking about the chaotic and unstable mental state that is the result of years of pain and suffering (Tormented). The latest track talks about the thoughts of complete dehumanization as the phrase goes \'kill or be killed\' (Fatality).\r\n\r\nPERFORMANCES:\r\n===========\r\n\r\nA Quarter Down Gig - Marine Centre, Vashi (May \'09)\r\nRunners Up @ Youth Opia, Central, Raghuleela Mall, Vashi (June \'09)\r\nWilson College Rock Fest, Grant Road (Sept \'09)\r\nMusic Liberation Union 6 - SIES College, Nerul (Sept \'09)\r\nBandwagon, Yuvana - R.N.Podar, Santacruz (Nov \'09)\r\nHeadlined @ PBG Festival - Palm Beach Galleria Mall, Vashi (Dec \'09)\r\nHigh Voltage \'09 - Ruia Collge, Matunga (Dec \'09)\r\nBattle Of The Bands - Thakur College, Kandivali (Dec \'09)\r\nRedemption \'09 - Sathaye College, Vile Parle (Dec \'09)\r\nRunners Up @ Prodigies \'10 - Tilak College, Vashi (Jan \'10)\r\nHeadlined @ Shikhar feat.

At the end of May 2001 Reptilian Death released its 1st recording which was a collection of 5 songs called \"5 Easy Ways To Murder Someone\" with each song representing a different method of murder. The songs were a mix of death metal and grindcore but contained the unusual element of humor which gave the whole concept a sort of spoof feel. After this release the project took a back seat until November 2001 which was when Reptilian Death turned from a solo project into a full fledged band after Husain joined as the bassist and Jaivir joined as guitarist and The Demonstealer took over drums and vocal duties. The band prepared itself with 2 new songs \"No Way To Die\" and \"The 2nd Coming Of Evil\" and traveled to Bangalore City to play its 1st live show at The National Law Schools event \"Strawberry Fields\". Sadly the show never happened and Reptilian Death ended up doing an acoustic death metal set at Planet M due to distortion not being allowed. \r\n\r\nThe band returned to Bombay and did their 1st proper gig at Razzberry Rhino. The bands high energy act and intensity got them a good response from people. Following which they recruited a 2nd guitar player, Girish Menon. The band continued touring the local college and club circuit and even bagged a best drummer and bass bassist at a local competition, which was unusual for a metal band to do.\r\n\r\nAfter the bands gig at the RAIT College festival in 2003 the band more or less stopped playing live as the band members were busy with other commitments. In July 2003 The Demonstealer decided to continue the project solo once again and followed up the earlier \"5 Easy Ways To Murder Someone\" with another concept song called \"Nursery Rhymes For Satan’s Children\" as well as recording the bands 5 originally composed songs and planed to release an album in August 2003.Things however did not go as planned and the album got postponed indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe Demonstealer then bought the band back together for IIT\'s Livewire show, where \r\nSunny (Epithap) replaced Jaivir on guitars and Nitin (Morticide) took over the main vocal duties. This is was a one off gig for the band and happened to be the last for Girish who passed away in Febuary 2004 after which the band pretty much stopped existing, but Demonstealer did go ahead and release the much awaited album titled ‘Total Annihilation’ in July 2004. \r\n\r\nAfter 2 years RD was resurrected for a briefly during the end of 2005 for 2 gigs where Pradeep (Demonic Resurrection) handling guitars and new member Sugath doing vocals. Following this the Demonstealer once again flew solo and wrote a new RD EP titled ‘Intestinal Feast’ where he handled all the music and Sugath featured as the vocalist and lyricist. The EP was released in late 2006 on a split CD called ‘Defaced and Split’ on Demonstealer Records. Following which the band started touring again with new guitarist Arjun, Husain (Bass), Sugath (Vocals) and Demonstealer (Drums). The band toured for almost a year after which it went back into hibernation.\r\n\r\nCurrently Demonstealer is writing material for a new release in 2010.\r\n','demonstealerrecords@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/ReptilianDeath/info','','http://soundcloud.com/reptiliandeath','http://www.reverbnation.com/reptiliandeath','0','2845',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','reptilian-death'),(329,0,15,15,'Hence Proved','','','http://www.facebook.com/henceproved/info','http://www.khagta.com','http://soundcloud.com/henceproved','http://www.reverbnation.com/henceproved','0','2814',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','hence-proved'),(330,0,71,11,'Prasanna','“Prasanna’s compositions convey a cosmopolitan harmonic language, rich with passing frictions”- New York Times\r\n\r\n“Prasanna plays guitar quite simply like nobody else on the planet” – Allabout Jazz\r\n\r\nPrasanna is the quintessential Indian Renaissance man.

The band essentially blends great vocal melody along with instrument harmony, and is based on experimentation with varied time signatures, jazz-influenced bass-lines and an Indian percussion instrument. But at the same time, we like to keep our music simple. As a group of musicians brewing our styles together, we also lay equal focus on the way we “sound” live and on record, giving importance to not just what we play, but also how all that playing comes together and mixes when it comes out on speakers; hence immense stress is laid on the production of our tracks.

As one of the country’s biggest EDM exports, he plays over 100 gigs a year, touring regularly in Europe and Asia, often spends his summers in the world’s techno Mecca, Berlin. A man with a true passion for underground music, which he relentlessly plays, produces and promotes. No wonder he was awarded 2011 – 2012’s Best Techno DJ and DJ Of the Year and more recently topped the DJ Mag India Poll.\r\n\r\nHe has played alongside such heavyweights as Fergie, Sasha, Fat Boy Slim, Dave Seaman, Nic Fanciulli, Paolo Mojo and Cari Lekebusch while his live act, Jalebee Cartel, has shared headlining spots with the likes of The Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy and Modeselektor. His knowledge and use of technology in the booth is second to none, often adding drum machines and samplers to create a uniquely raw, funk-laden techno set.\r\n\r\nIt has been almost 10 years since Arjun, along with 3 friends, formed India’s biggest live act, Jalebee Cartel. With its genre-bending sets, the band has generated a huge buzz and has featured in DJ Mag, MixMag and Elle’s list of Rising Stars, and has even graced the cover of Rolling Stone, India. The live act has released over 50 singles on Ostwind Records, Neurotraxx Deluxe, Vapour, Baroque among others. 2009 saw the release of Jalebee’s critically acclaimed debut album, ONEPOINTNOTHING.\r\n\r\nBut it is Arjun’s solo productions that are now making some serious noise.\r\n\r\n2010 saw the release of “Kill the String” on Tom Budden’s ALiVE Recordings. It quickly caught the ear of Fergie, who played it on Digweed’s Transitions to great feedback and immediately commissioned Arjun for an EP on his new Tribal Rage imprint, and followed it with two Vinyl releases on Excentric Mizik. Carl Cox, Karotte, Kaserdisco, Sebastien Leger all supported these heavily. Remixes for Fergie, Denis Horvat, Solead, Dale Anderson, Mabaan Soul and a chart topper for Montero followed. His single with Cologne’s Traum family - Trapez Ltd, was much applauded by DJ’s and clubbers alike while his collaboration with Tim Richards on Kaiserdisco’s KD Music stayed on the Digital & Vinyl charts for well over a month, getting multiple plays from a certain Richie Hawtin. Further releases on Mihalis Safras’s Material Series, Sian’s Octopus, Berlin based Hummingbird & Monaque Speciale are to follow along with some tasty collaborations.\r\n\r\nNever one to play Top 10 tunes, Arjun’s always scouting out fresh underground tracks – the man never sleeps! His latest venture has been to found and manage a young record label, Mak.Tub Music, with partner Logistic Soundz. Over the last three years, the imprint has an impressive roster of artists, including Alex Dolby, Fiord, Jay Haze, Pawas, Jimmy Van M, Dave Ellesmere, Ray Kajioka, and has already hit the coveted Beatport charts.\r\n\r\nThere’s good reason that Arjun Vagale’s name has become synonymous with high quality in the Electronic Music scene.

They then resolutely locked themselves in a world of their own and remained in the room for about 6 months trying to understand the gravity of relation between them, music and the rest of the world. Music was no longer just their passion; it became their sole mode of expression.  \r\n\r\nWith the hunger to play their music to people everywhere, they shifted base to Guwahati city. Still not finding enough venues that host rock bands and the absence of a music scene they started sharing their songs online and active discussions/debates in forums soon creating an independent scene where now there is a show every month.\r\n\r\nDigital Suicide is the new voice of independent rock scene of India. Strong bass and drum groove acts as the driving force behind the band’s music with the guitar providing simple atmospheric and ambient textures to the songs rather than just carrying the melody. Digital Suicide’s flirtation with 70’s disco and 80’s pop melodies reflect on their vocal melodies. Their music has been inspired by the works of R. D. Barman, Bappi Lahiri, Classical Music, bands like RHCP, Placebo, Joy Division, R.E.M., Sonic Youth, Lady Gaga, MJ, Radiohead, etc. \r\n\r\nThe band has proved their critics wrong and continue to play their brand of contemporary alternative music constantly creating positive energy in and around them.

Then he started visiting Ibiza every summer. Back and forth until he was seven. After which he continued going to school in Ibiza with his partner in crime Levin. It was there that he began Dj’ing with only 12 at the one of the most famous club, the Blue Rose. Since then he has been playing in clubs and parties around the Island.

Certainly a band of four brown-skinned boys whose collective faces look equally at home on a terrorist watchlist as any promotional poster is, well, unique. That all of the members are of Indian descent at a time when Indian culture is exploding globally is surely… noteworthy. “We gave up on fitting in a long time ago,” states singer/guitarist Avir Mitra with a shrug.\r\n\r\n Mix innovative hooks and lean guitars with urban inspired beats and subtle world flavor, add a dash of Brooklyn cred but temper it with a lyrical openness – now you begin to get at the sound of Armour, their Epic Records debut. It’s future-feeling and it’s retro and it almost didn’t happen. \r\n\r\nAs the story goes, Avir was only days away from joining medical school when the band got a life-changing phone call: they had won MTVu’s Best Music on Campus contest and would be signing with Epic. They would perform on “Late Night with Conan O’Brien” in a few days.  Welcome to Bamboo Shoots’ world. \r\n\r\nAvir and bassist/vocalist Karl Sukhia began playing music together after bumping heads as kids in the Zoroastrian community to which their parents belonged.  They recorded songs on an old PC with a pencil mic. It was several years before they met drummer Shiv Puri, a brilliant finance student who needed something more to crunch than numbers – Shiv soon found his salvation in drumming with the duo. At their first practice, friend of a friend Ankur Patel showed up with what was to become a key ingredient – an Indian folk drum called the dhol. They covered Hall and Oates. Finally, Ankur, an up-and-coming DJ, wove 808s and percussion into the mix and was in the band by day’s end to seal the lineup.\r\n\r\nFast-forward through the time spent lugging gear, sleeping on floors and scrounging cash for studio time.  It’s 2008 and the band is signed and ready to record. They’ve toured with Plain White T’s, rocked shows with Soulja Boy, locked in a Gibson sponsorship and just finished a national ad campaign with Virgin. Jerry Harrison (of Talking Heads and Modern Lovers) was the first to see Bamboo Shoots’ potential and signed on as producer.\r\n\r\n“Talking Heads’ style stemmed from rhythm – we saw a common thread there,” explains Avir.  “Jerry dusted off old Heads’ synths and guitars that hadn’t been touched in years,” adds Karl.  “Avir played most of the album on the same Strat that was used on Stop Making Sense.” \r\n\r\nThe band proceeded to cold call their favorite mixer, UK-based Mark “Spike” Stent. His familiarity with both pop (Madonna, Beyonce, U2) and indie (MIA, Arcade Fire, CSS) matched perfectly with the band’s vision. Despite more lucrative offers, Spike heard something in the tracks and eagerly signed on to mix.  \"Everyone in the studio was curious to see who this baby band was that Spike had chosen to work with,\" notes Shiv. \r\n\r\nThe result, Armour, is a debut that effortlessly sounds unlike any of its peers.  “Hey Girl,” a throwback to Prince’s “Controversy,” sets the tone with a sing-along verse and a bassline that stabs you over and over. From there, the band never loses their laser-like focus on hooks, beats and vibe.  “Where the Ocean Meets the Road” feels like it should have been on the Days of Thunder Soundtrack.  You would focus on the retro cool, but you are too busy humming it in your head.  Ballads like “Whenever You’re Around” conjure up comparisons to Justin Timberlake’s solo work, until of course a shrieking guitar comes in and throws off the entire comparison. Tracks like “Milk, Satin & Silk” get the hipsters blogging, while “Wrong All Along” cuts to the angsty chase and gets the teens bopping.  Bamboo Shoots is equal parts Brooklyn and suburban New Jersey, and Armour reflects it. \r\n\r\nStill, it’s hard to describe the reaction Bamboo Shoots gets at their live shows, where sets become excuses for all-night dance parties. Things just connect.  A recent media-frenzied tour of India only fuels suspicion that the appeal of Bamboo Shoots could be exceptionally broad. Indeed, there is something unpredictably odd going on here. Let’s hope it stays that way.','laura@bigfatcat.net','http://www.facebook.com/bambooshoots/info','http://www.bambooshoots.com','','','0','2518',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','bamboo-shoots'),(359,0,1,1,'THINK FLOYD','\"Wot\'s uh.. the deal?\" [OBSCURED BY CLOUDS 1969] \r\n	Pink Floyd were the pioneers of psychedelic music and one of the biggest selling acts ever on the planet.

Their sometimes dreamy, sometimes chaotic sound has found wide appreciation among a varied group of fans, primarily on the basis of their gigs and a bunch of early, low-fi demos.Spanning multiple genres, but primarily grounded in folk, punk, and blues, Dischordian’s sound is difficult to categorise or describe. As Garreth says, “I know what to call the things that go in; I don’t know what to call what comes out.” The band’s own favourite description comes from NH7: ‘Goa-tinged orchestral indie rock’.Since the band’s inception, they’ve been featured twice on Stupid Ditties, the annual compilation of some of the country’s best underground acts, and in 2009 they were named as one of the most promising indie acts of the year by Indiecision. In April 2011, Dischordian released its much-awaited debut album The Feni Farm Riot. The album features the more minimal, stripped down sound of the band’s early days, with arrangements consisting primarily of guitars, percussion, and trumpet. Recorded and mixed by Aviv Pereira, mastered by Zorran Mendonsa, and with artwork by Hemant Kumar, the album has received an almost universally positive response from the Indian underground scene. \r\n\r\n\r\nPRESS\r\n“…a stunning debut album… showcases Garreth’s skills as a songwriter as he crafts minimalistic melancholy songs and sinister ballads with accomplished ease. This isn’t cheerful guitar-pop, this is an album of simple and achingly beautiful songs about love, hate, and death that remind you of sleepless, lonely nights spent in the warm embrace of mild despair that sneaks up on you in the early hours of the morning… a well composed and intimate album by experienced and talented musicians at the top of their game. ...one of the best albums you will hear this year.”\r\nBhanuj Kappal - The Big M\r\n“Dischordian’s sound took just a little bit to settle in, after the bass-heavy Bombay Bassment but damn, can they write songs. The whole crowd was singing along. The absence of a full drum kit lent their sound a very gypsy feel; all I could think of as I sang along was ‘drinking songs!’”\r\nRonit Sarkar - Sonic Buzz\r\n“…D’Mello’s whisky-soaked vocals are served through a finely shaped musical decanter made up of trumpet player Agnelo “Aggie” Picardo, guitarist Howard Pereira and saxophone and melodica player Nigel Rajaratnam. With a singing and writing style that doffs its hat to everyone from Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen to Tom Waits and Eddie Vedder, Dischordian is one of those bands that often says the sourest things in the sweetest ways. This is best exemplified on such catchy but caustic material like “The Old Whore” and “Your Right Heel” that appear on their brilliantly titled debut album The Feni Farm Riot...”\r\nMumbai Boss Editors - Mumbai Boss\r\n“...they\'ve slowly and surely fashioned their own effective DIY ethic; one that, given their unique brand of music and their workman-like drive to keep playing as many gigs as possible, will undoubtedly pay dividends in the coming years. …the contingent of fans at the venue knew the words to almost all of the 18 songs (including a popular parody of \'La Bamba\' called \'Mera Sabse Lamba\') performed on the night, singing back with feni-powered (the band handed out free shots of the popular Goan hooch) vigour and vociferously demanding an extended encore... ”\r\nArjun S Ravi - The Sunday Guardian\r\n“…whether it was the Feni shots, the strategically placed merchandise, the brilliant set, or a combination of everything, Dischordian certainly launched their debut album in style… for anyone hoping to sell their music, I’d say that this is way to do it!”\r\nArjun Sathe - Whats The Scene India\r\n“‘The Old Whore’ has become something of a cult underground anthem, and it’s not difficult to see why. A very strong melody coupled with cleverly written lyrics make the song instantly likeable. …one of the most original and accomplished albums to emerge from the Indian Indie music scene. It is an album that reflects distinctly mature songwriting, captured in an extremely raw and organic form.”\r\nAalok Padhye of Something Relevant - What The Scene India\r\n“The band performed a nearly two hour-long set comprised of material from the album and a few cuts that aren’t on the album as well. Powered by a contingent of hardcore fans, the quartet played the best Dischordian set we’ve seen to date, totally engulfing the Lower Parel venue with their own private party – a refreshing brand of Goa-tinged orchestral indie rock, the members of the band dressed in suit vests and fedoras, and free shots of feni passed around.”\r\n','','http://www.facebook.com/Dischordian','','','','55325967345','2495',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','dischordian'),(362,0,3,3,'CROSS Legacy','Cross Legacy is an Indian Christian rock band formed in Bangalore, Karnataka in 2006.

Motherjane was formed to fill in for the Professional act which had suddenly opted out of the Rock show. The first stroke of luck for Motherjane had sounded!\r\n\r\nIn 1996, featuring the combined talents of John Thomas(Drums), Clyde Rozario (Bass), Mithun (Guitars) and Laji (Vocals), the band went on to make an explosive debut wowing their peers within a week of their formation.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Motherjane released a 3 song EP that got lost amongst the wilderness of Kerala, where many a poterntaily great rock bands got lost in the 80s and 90s.\r\n\r\nMotherjane then went thru the agonizing process of losing the talents of 2 of its founding members who went in pursuit of their individual dreams. By 1999 the mercurial and talented Baiju took over duties as axeman &, Motherjane entered a partial state of limbo becoming a 3 member team with John & Clyde still holding on.\r\n\r\nFor over a year the band played metal songs (without a vocalist!) at The Ancient Mariner” a floating restaurant in Kochi to an unsuspecting & astounded audience that walked into the quaint pier like structure built in the backwaters.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, then a young businessman by the name of Suraj Mani, chanced into “The ancient mariner” and egged on by his friend, jammed with the band. Almost coincidently at the same time a talented young guitarist called Rex also moved into this loosely bound group.\r\n\r\nWithin a week of juggling his time between work and music, Suraj was already trying to move on. Attempting to excuse himself with an observation on the lack of future that confronts cover bands, his proposed exit lines were, “If we were making our own music, it would mean something. At least then 10 years down the line, we can’t be just replaced by the next band of talented young musicians who would play these covers with more energy.” Baiju looked up and said, “lets make a song”\r\n\r\nThat moment for any band heralds its real beginning. By 2001-02 the band had composed, performed and recorded 9 songs in an album that they called “insane biography”. During this period, the band was already coping with the logistical horrors of practice & recording, since Suraj had shifted base to Bangalore. Overcoming its difficulties, the band went on to perform all over the Indian sub continent gaining from strength to strength and winning numerous competitions and awards. Most notable amongst them in the first half of band’s career was the award for best Indian rock album in the year 2002-03.\r\n\r\nMotherjane, (the band’s guardian angel- named in homage to the bands belief that music is by far the best and purest drug in the world) was making her presence felt and her sons heard!\r\n\r\nThen Rex left in 2002. It was the day before the Great Indian Rock concert, where for the first time a band from the serene and lost state of Kerala had managed to break into. The band was lost again.\r\n\r\nFor 2 years the band went thru stand in guitarists for their rhythm section, all the while performing, learning and growing in stature. Amidst all the turmoil, Insae Biography was creating ripples in the rock circuit. The band’s album became the first Indian rock album to be featured in international radio stations across 3 continents. The song Soul Corporations was bought for an international compilation album “Geki Teki Metal” released in Japan in 2004. Motherjane’s live acts were getting rave reviews across the country. DNA networks rated the band as one of the top 3 live acts in the country. Always working for the inevitable success that they craved, Motherjane welcomed Deepu in late 2004. Once again the vibe was back and within 6 months the band was composing new material.\r\n\r\nThe band will be bringing out their new album titled “Maktub” in 2007 and has further developed their sound into something that is uniquely Motherjane and attracts a cult following amongst the thinking rocker. The songs from the latest recordings got the boys laurels with Baiju winning the award for the guitarist of the year 2007 at the JD Tennesse Annual Rock awards and Suraj being nominated for the vocalist of the year. What most bands from the so-called rock hubs of India could not achieve in years in the Indian rock circuit, Motherjane - a band hailing from the remotest islands of Kerala did so in no time with their perseverence, thereby, becoming an inspiration for most rock bands that have gained fame over the last few years.\r\n\r\nMotherjane’s fascinating musical style flows with the melody of rural India, seethes with the raw aggression of rock and is inlaid with lyrics of exquisite insight .The band is going to re-record “insane biography” along with “Maktub” as a special tribute to its fans.\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing that Motherjane has lived by, it is the gut feeling that success is more about what one overcomes than just achievements.\r\n\r\nThis band has overcome much more than the milestones it is known for and is still growing stronger and stronger on its journey to reach its world wide audience.\r\n\r\nIt seems apt here to leave with the lyrics of “walk on” from the album “Insane Biography”-\r\n\r\n“I’m the immortal, baptized in fire\r\nUnable to die unless I desire\r\nI’m the light piercing the darkest dawn\r\nI’m the human spirit, walking on.”\r\n\r\nWelcome to the band .\r\n','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Motherjane/10612624134','http://www.motherjane.net','','','10612624134','2351',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','motherjane-1'),(375,0,64,64,'Thriloka','Resonances of Raskhas & Nagas …\r\n\r\nHumanity’s most precious gift is the ability to appreciate art – The most natural tendency of the human psyche To appreciate art is to recreate our five senses: Unlike smell, taste & touch Sight & Sound evolved in tandem, & are now primary forms of communication.\r\n\r\nEven before birth, we learn to decipher sounds in the womb Rhythms fused with our own heartbeats, engulfed soon by the sounds, movements & changes of the world: Appearance & Disappearance, Silence & its absence, Our entire being soon embraced & rocked by these Rhythms.\r\n\r\nIs not ‘just another band’.

The collective has played extensively in the festival circuit including Three years at the Sunburn Festival in Goa, Two years at the Bacardi NH7 Weekender and Once at Invasion Festival. In addition to this, BBC’s successful tour of Europe in August 2010 through Germany and the UK have put them on the world map.

They will be the first ever Indian artist to take on the stage at this festival.\r\n\r\nBBC have injected fun into a scene, which was mutating into an increasingly austere and po-faced arena.

The BBC are changing trends and inspiring newer players in India with regularly packed alternative beat nights all over the country and are truly one of the emerging collectives of a much required alternative, intellectual order.

On papers, LOW RHYDERZ is a brand founded by four partners. They exist solely to get the whole world grinding, vibing, jiving and forgetting each other’s differences which leads to great by-products namely HAPPINESS and PEACE. Their music testifies to their aims which is unusual and big. ‘Cos they know that to have aim small is a crime in today’s world.\r\n\r\nInitially, it was hard work for them to get people listen to their music. They were an unknown band making unfamiliar music in the sub continent. But over time, converting the first time hesitant listener into an instant fan became cake-walk. Band LOW RHYDERZ is the driving force of Brand LOW RHYDEZ. Versatility and style is the key to all the music they make and the business they do. However, Urban (Hip hop , Rap and Reggae) music will always be their basic thing and they say, “ Our lives relate to it automatically, naturally, lyrically, metaphorically and emotionally “.\r\n\r\nThough they started over three years ago, they are still on a journey with notable performances including The National Equestrian and Horse Ridding Championship ( Pondicherry ), India Men’s Fashion Fair ( Bangalore ), Tata Tea’s “Jago Re” campaign at Wipro Campus ( Bangalore ), Colour nites by Bangalore Times ( Bangalore ) and other performances in prominent night clubs across South Indian States. RAVE magazine wrote about LOW RHYDERZ after witnessing them live in 2007. Their work was also acknowledged by a leading daily tabloid called the “Deccan Chronicle”. \r\n\r\nTwo of their music videos drew attention when they were aired by India’s leading English news channel “CNN IBN” in 2007 and 2009 respectively. The first video and soundtrack depicted the evolution of 60 years of Indian independence. The second one was a politically aggressive message to the youth specially, which was part of the CNN IBN’s “ROCK THE VOTE” campaign during the Great Indian General Elections. They’ve recorded and performed with country’s leading Djs, Musicians & artists from France, Cameroon, Tanzania, Iran and Oman . \r\n\r\nRight now, be the first to know that the much anticipated debut album “OUTTA NOWHERE” is dropping this year.

He soon found Daniel Johansson, a young but experienced and very talented guitar player who welded a traditional metal guitar style. The two started working on some of Harry\'s earlier material and began to write new songs. After a long and tiresome search, Harry then found Oscar Carlquist; a powerful heavy metal vocalist with a mutual hatred for the current metal scene. Oscar quickly became involved in the song writing process and quickly crafted interesting lyrics to accompany the music. The backbone of RAM was formed. Oscar brought in drummer Morgan Pettersson, one of the few drummers left who still played the 70/80\'s hard and heavy drumming style. They then recruited the legendary Leif Larsson, an icon in Gothenburg metal as he had previously been a member of \"Frozen Eyes\".\r\n\r\nThe five members started to rehearse and write new songs and in 2003 they released their first E.P., Sudden Impact, through partly their own label \"Black Path Metal Recordings\". The EP created a sudden impact on the underground metal scene, the first 1000 copies were sold out in a few months. RAM hit the road and played a number of festivals in Europe and went on tour as support for Sebastian Bach. The band was also recognised by Germany\'s Rock Hard magazine as one of the best newcomers of 2004.\r\n\r\nRAM kept on playing live throughout most of \'05 and started working on their full-length debut album Forced Entry, which was released in late 2005. Forced Entry brought the entire old school heavy metal community to its knees. The album is a pure sonic attack of real and innovative heavy metal. Great reviews followed and the band grew even bigger. In December \'05, RAM hit the road with Dark Tranquillity and in Jan \'06 they performed at several Scandinavian shows with Gamma Ray.\r\n\r\nPlaying live is what RAM does best and in 2006-2007, the band delivered a devastating metal crusade over Europe. Reaching places such as Greece for the first time and Spain for the second time, the Teutonic hordes went wild. In the summer of 2007, bass player Leif Larsson was asked to leave the band due to personal differences and Tyrant of the Black Metal ultra cult act Nifelheim answered the call and joined RAM as a session bassplayer.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the band returned to the studio with producer Johan Reivén to record the album Lightbringer. This time they really took the time to explore the true heavy metal sound. The recording of the album took 10 months of nothing but strife for pure heavy metal perfection.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, RAM signed a deal with AFM records and released Lightbringer, which received very good reviews. It landed a spot as one of the best albums of 2009 in Sweden Rock magazine. The band also headed out on headline European tour to promote the album. Tobbe Peterson joined the band and through his amazing bass skills made this the strongest RAM lineup ever.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, RAM went back into the studio to record their yet unreleased third album called Death. This time they worked with producers Per Stålberg and Olle Björk to create their best album to date by far.

From initially playing the ‘’tabla’’ (Indian drums) alongside his father in concerts, Pawas’ musical prowess was evident almost instantly as he quickly taught himself to play numerous other instruments including percussion, bass guitar and keyboards.\r\n\r\nFollowing in his father’s footsteps, Pawas soon chose to persue a career within his new found love of electronic music. At age 17, he began DJing in his native India. Pawas’ move to Europe in 2004 brought him to another level of success.\r\n\r\nWith his DJing talents becoming recognised around central Europe, production was the next step for Pawas. After the instant success of his first solo record ‘Katang’ in early 07, Pawas’ own productions together with his highly acclaimed collaborations with his best friend and fellow dance heavyweight Daso, has seen the adopted German causing a stir within the global scene.\r\n\r\nAfter releases on labels such as Spectral Sound, Flash, Squonk and Connaisseur plus smash hits such as ‘Bummelzug’, ‘Det’ and ‘Crawl Around’, a legion of the world;s top DJs and producers have all joined the Pawas fan club, including Dubfire, John Digweed, Hernan Cattaneo, Marc Romboy, Luciano, Jimpster, Satoshie Tomiie etc. Pawas’ deep,\r\n\r\nDetroit influenced style of house and techno has now become a much demanded recipe within dance music and DJ gigs in the likes of Switzerland, Spain, Norway, Dubai, Sweden and throughout Germany over the last year are an indication of this….\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\r\n::::::: DISCOGRAPHY::::::::\r\n\r\n-- SINGLES---\r\n\r\n- Katang / Che Che - Pawas & Beume (squonk)\r\n- Playtex EP - Pawas (fear of flying)\r\n- Night Express - Daso & Pawas (Flash)\r\n- Never met them EP - Pawas (Flash)\r\n- Only Lycra / Frispo - Pawas & Beume (Squonk)\r\n- Det EP - Daso & Pawas (Spectral Sound)\r\n- Squonk 09 - Pawas & Beume (squonk)\r\n- Rednecks EP - Pawas & Beume (Brut !)\r\n- Mazo EP - Pawas (fear of flying)\r\n- Music for lazy people EP - Pawas (Night Drive music)\r\n- Alessio EP - Pawas & Beume (Niveous)\r\n- Online EP - BLM & Pawas (fear of flying)\r\n- El Paso (w / Yapacc & Butch remixes) – Daso & Pawas (Brise Records)\r\n- Romeo (Dave ellesmere / Ray Kajioka rmx) – Pawas (Mak.tub)\r\n- The Dhaba EP – Low volume (Fear of flying)\r\n\r\n--- REMIXES---\r\n\r\n- KNVPB (Pawas remix) - SCSI 9 (Fear of Flying)\r\n- Mondscheinprimaten (Pawas remix) - Kollektive Turmstrasse (Baalsaal)\r\n- Sapphire (Daso & Pawas remix) - Sami Koivikko (Spectral)\r\n- Romm 228 (Daso & Pawas remix) - Robsound\r\n- Last Tango (Daso & Pawas remix) - Butch & Julie \r\n- Röter Schlauch (Pawas remix) - Forty6 & two (PSLTD)\r\n- Salzwasserliebe (pawas remix) - Ostwind records\r\n- Supergooses (Pawas remix) – Federleicht (NDMLtd)\r\n- Spaceflake Remixes (Pawas / Ali kuru remixes) – M.

The music industry was awash gangster-rappers, disgusting pop singers and mundane club bands that played the same set of covers every night! A change was in dire need!

Our devotion to our art is ardent. Managing day jobs and college while carrying the band forward is not an easy task, especially in a country with very little or no backers for this particular genre of music. But as a band it is our central belief that if there is a will, there is a way.

Rock, trip-hop, minimal, funk, house, trance; his eager ears find sounds everywhere in order to create tomorrow’s ones.\r\n\r\nSo, how to qualify his music?... Always really deep and dark, he removes the hearts and souls with his minimalist electro. A strong techno beat, precise and acute; serpentine synthesizer melodies; a hate of obvious structures; destabilising noises: all an atmosphere that he creates, to make the listener rise from ecstatic heights to the black depths of human spirit.\r\n\r\nHis first EP began the legend. Is it deep? seduced a huge amount of techno freaks and DJs, like Lucio and Pep and Digital Filth who remixed his tracks, or Cosmopolitan who wanted him to remix for them. Now he’s on the edge of another acid revolution with his new album \"Elements of Density\".\r\n\r\nMore than a DJ, he’s a real creator, a true artist with a vision and a goal: transform music and let hearts shake.\r\n\r\nDISCOGRAPHY ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\nRELEASES ///\r\nMoog Conspiracy & Breger – Screenshot (Elektrotribe) (2010)\r\nMoog Conspiracy - Promenade (Buena Onda) (2009)\r\nMoog Conspiracy & Breger - Hinterhalt (Elektrotribe) (2009)\r\nMoog Conspiracy - Ground Zero (Elektrotribe) (2008)\r\nMoog Conspiracy - Elements of Density (remixes) (Elektrotribe) (2008)\r\nMoog Conspiracy - Elements of Density (Album) (Elektrotribe) (2007)\r\nMoog Conspiracy - Is it Deep?

Extolling the virtues of Vedic philosophy and integrating those into a contemporary metal articulation, the band evinces a discernible novelty in their approach towards the otherwise so popular form of music. Incepted as a four piece outfit, the band also witnessed a series of line up and configuration changes and currently is unwavering with its three components - Saurabh Babbar (Guitars and Backing Vocals), Shivam Gautom (Drums) and Chaitanya Awasthi (Bass and Vocals).\r\n\r\nThe torchbearers of Vedic Metal in India, Bhairav brings round Vedic Metal in line with classical Thrash/Extreme metal scene of the 80\'s, as laid down by famed mammoths like Slayer, Kreator, Sepultura, Metallica, Megadeth, Sodom, Holy Moses, Coroner, Exumer etc.\r\n\r\nEarly influences of the Gods of Extreme Metal and their obsession for antediluvian Hindu Mythologizes bloomed to define the characteristic shred sound of the band, which is an amalgamation of 80\'s Old School Metal and Indian classical music, mainly in terms of scales. Experimenting with different musical tones, the band occasionally issues various ethnic percussion instruments into their music to present a rustic Indian flavor.\r\n\r\nLyrically, the band is magnetized by various concepts of Vedic philosophy and many aspects of Indian mythology, which seem to perfectly blend in a style of music as heavy as theirs. The name itself signifies the band\'s roots, as ‘Bhairav’ is one of the Indian classical raagas, as well as the name of the fiercest manifestation of Lord Shiva.\r\n\r\nIn the past two years, the band has been quite active in the underground metal circuit in Delhi and received both critical and commercial success. The band has started branching out its creative milieu and earned mainstream recognition by performing in sundry spheres. After having found its musical direction, the band has been working on original material and is now ready to take on the stage, looking for opportunity to present their unique approach towards music in front of all.\r\n\r\nOm Bhairavaye Namaha !','+919716774080','http://www.facebook.com/bhairav.vedic','http://www.bhairavindia.com','','','210591515232','2054',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','bhairav'),(421,0,3,3,'Forsaken - India','Join us @ http://www.facebook.com/forsakenindia\r\n\r\nAchievements:\r\n\r\n1.

Yet still Buddhima felt the apparent need for a lead guitarist and it was this very need that inspired a new head hunt! \r\nThe Man they were looking for came in the form of Milo, Guitarist extraordinaire/ songwriter, it goes without saying that it was indeed his addition that propelled Wagon Park into what they stand for today! \r\nUndying Passion, sincere dedication and pure home bred rock and roll!!!\r\n\r\nSumedha Nuwan then stepped in as Band Manager and it was his inclusion that brought the band a great deal of professionalism which was certainly a prerequisite for any band that was pretty serious about their Music! Wagon Park was and so the addition was more than welcomed! \r\n\r\nWith the band now Complete and all raring to go, along came TNL Onstage a significant event in the sri lankan music calendar ,Onstage provided young artists and bands with the opportunity to deliver their music to a wider audience and go places! Or so IT claimed!\r\nTaking part in a competition of such magnitude was no easy task as the band found out for themselves. \r\nCountless rehearsals, interviews and the various other nitty gritties   that go into taking part in a Competition and being in the spotlight had to be seen to! \r\nAnd finally when the time had come to perform, Wagon Park delivered, and delivered in every sense of the word!\r\n\r\nFrom never before seen showmanship, to brilliantly executed compositions Wagon Park stunned audiences with a truly intense live performance of both originals and covers! The band entered the Finals of TNL Onstage as expected and once again provided a packed house of nearly 3,000 people with a truly spellbinding performance of Pink Floyd’s Classic ‘Comfortably Numb’. Unfortunately the band did not emerge winners but it was this very fact that served as the driving force to achieve what they termed at that time ‘Bigger Things’ in music!\r\n\r\nSadly soon after the Finals Lead Guitarist Milo had to leave for a year due to prior commitments and it was his departure that created the opening for keyboardist Nuwan Tharanga to join the band! He soon blended in well and was unanimously selected as a permanent member of the band!\r\n\r\nAs the band continued on its quest to taking Original Sri Lankan Hard Rock to a wider audience Video Image Sri Lanka’s premier Production House approached the band after identifying the bands’ prowess as musicians! And it is with this collaboration that Wagon Park will release their Debut album in 2012 appropriately titled Stoned!\r\n\r\nWhile the final rites are being performed for the album launch, Video Image and Wagon Park have taken another Giant step in revolutionizing the Sri Lankan entertainment industry with a strikingly different video concept for Wagon Park’s Hit Single Flat by the use silhouettes and never before seen Light and shadow effects! \r\n\r\nWagon Park has also independently released a Patriotic Sinhala Song titled “Jayaganwan” for which the band has received rave reviews for the songs lyrical content and seemingly picturesque video!  \r\n\r\nWagon Park has also independently Released a Live performance CD titled NOW IS HERE which contains band originals, plus covers from renowned artists such as Johny Cash, The Beatles, Bob Dylan and Bob Marley!  \r\n\r\nWhile the world awaits the official album release of STONED the band continues to innovate, motivate and tirelessly tear down the boundaries of a false prejudice that Asian Bands are no more than a farce! \r\n\r\nIt would be more than fitting to end this note with the very words of Milo “Music is a way of revealing one\'s inner reflections and we find our counterpoint in the music of that era as it truly describes who we are and what we truly believe in.”\r\n \r\n','Sumedha: +94777752070 / Milo - 0777666305','http://www.facebook.com/WagonPark','http://www.wagonpark.com','','','348456844742','1995',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','wagon-park'),(424,0,1,1,'TECHNODROME FESTIVAL','TechnoDrome is an electronic music & urban arts festival started by BLOT! & Qilla records in 2009.\r\n\r\nWith electronic music as the backbone of the series, the programming for each festival episode pulls in forerunners from the global music and arts scene, and pitches them with leading Indian artists and performers.\r\n\r\nTechnoDrome has hosted acclaimed electronic musicians including SQL (Netherlands), D.Sens (France), Child (Australia), Jitter, BLOT, Nucleya and Kohra (India) and widely regarded visual artists Evgeny Kiselev (Russia) & 4youreye (Austria) in its past editions.\r\n\r\nThe 2012 edition is poised to be the biggest episode yet, with Oliver Huntemann (Ideal Audio)(DE) & Light Surgeons (UK) headlining the festival alongside the leaders of electronica within the domestic circuit.

With a 18,000+ fanbase on myspace and reverbnation, and after spending three months on the top of the, \"ALL GENRES\", \"HIP-HOP\", \"POP\" and \"R&B\" charts of MySpace India, Kacey Bridges is an artist about whom you\'re gonna hear a lot about in the days to come.  Being a \"Sucker for Music\", as he says it, Kacey started off as a music producer back when he was in the eighth grade at the age of only 13, which was when he started workin on his skills as a producer, composer, singer, songwriter and a rapper. Soon enough, Kacey would go on to produce for his brother\'s EP release \"Geek Turned Monsta\" which includes breezy fresh tracks from Kacey\'s brother - B-Reft - alongside Kacey\'s unique production.\r\n\r\nExplaining how he got the idea of producing his own album, Kacey says that during the production of B-Reft\'s album, there were certain scores, melodies and lyrics that just weren\'t right for a rap album. So after giving it some time, Kacey would decide to make his own album where he would be including 4 songs from different genres -------- ranging from CLUB to POP to R&B to HIP-HOP -------- although the artist says that his album is mainly POP. The album titled \"XOXO\" is yet to be released online, although Kacey\'s MySpace hit \"Take This City On A Roll\" aired on his homepage (www.myspace.com/kaceybridges) and stayed at #1 spot for 3 months beating the likes of Pitbull, Akon and T-Pain.\r\n\r\nWith a unique sense of style and a personality which the 19 year old says lies somewhere on a \"thin line between being weird and being awesome\", Kacey Bridges is not your everyday popstar. Some consider him a celebrity already; and for the ones who don\'t, say that he\'s got what it takes to make it up in the music industry - National or International. So till the \"SHOOTING STAR\" finally hits your TV Screen, you can check him and his tracks out on - \r\n\r\nMySpace -  www.myspace.com/kaceybridges\r\nReverbnation - www.reverbnation.com/kaceybridges\r\nFacebook - www.facebook.com/kaceybridges.\r\n\r\nLeaving you with a tune to humm, here\'s the download link to the new Kacey Bridges party anthem \"Take This City On A Roll\" featuring B-Reft.\r\n\r\nhttp://k003.kiwi6.com/hotlink/0c58j7f88h/kacey_bridges_take_this_city_on_a_roll.mp3','','http://www.facebook.com/kaceybridges','http://www.youtube.com/kaceybridges','','','128177715030','1918',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','kacey-bridges'),(437,0,1,1,'Dj DeViL - The Electro Mafia','Dj DeViL India (aka Parakh Mathur) is a young and talented Dj/Producer,all the way from INDIA.He is 18 yrs. old now (from 1994) \nHe started the Production at the age of 14,mostly into ELECTRONIC Music.Also the YOUNGEST DUBSTEP PRODUCER of India. \nCheck out his Stuff and start following him to experience the new generation Electronic and Dubstep music.\n\nSo Cheers for the young talent \nDj DeViL India','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dj-DeViL-The-Electro-Mafia/169003889779160','','','','169003889779160','1916',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','dj-devil-the-electro-mafia'),(438,0,4,4,'Existence Failed','        Existence Failed plays an amalgamation of Modern Metal, which can be best described as Groove-laced rhythm structures, melodic interludes and powerful vocals, sprinkled with polyrhythms and massive low end chugging.

Rishi, Santa, Tarit, Ritesh, Anugrah and Gautam – six fellows who could hear nothing but the sound of music and speak nothing but the language of melody – were brought together by their love for music.\r\n\r\nIt all began just shy of a year…emerging from different spheres of life, their love and passion for music tied them together and the outcome that we have today is \'Rishi Inc.\' - a \'rhythm emerging from perfect harmony between a man and his soul\'.\r\n\r\nMusic has a unique essence which makes it singular for different consciousnesses. But for them, music is about bringing out the serenity, purity and authenticity of one\'s being, with a slight touch of novelty. And living in the most diverse nation of all, India, what could be better than bringing out that very serenity, purity and authenticity of our motherland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir Journey\r\n\r\nThough Rishi and his friends started walking on their respective paths of music very early in their lives, they were brought together not more than a year ago to form Rishi Inc.\r\n\r\nIt all began when Rishi met Santa during his graduation days. Both shared each other’s enthusiasm for music; while Rishi knew what keys to strike to bring out the perfect melody from his piano, Santa was a man with a golden voice to say the least. As wonderful as the combination could be, together they fulfilled their commitment to music by creating some soulful compositions.\r\n\r\nLater, the duo was joined by Tarit, an expert in catching beats and flowing them out through his tabla. The trio joined hands a year ago, and created music very different from the ordinary. Their eclectic production was some later joined by Ritesh, whose mesmerizing talent with the flute brought a different feel to the entire sound.\r\n\r\nMost recently, at a chance meeting, the now developing Rishi Inc. happened to be introduced to Anugrah and Gautam, who threw in their skills at the rhythm section at the band’s disposal. This led to the band attaining equilibrium, with three members from western classical and three from indian classical background putting their heads together.\r\n\r\nNow finally complete and able to begin their musical venture, Rishi Inc. is ready to take on the world with their music! \r\n','rishiincband@gmail.com, Rishi Dutta :- 07838222977','http://www.facebook.com/rishiinc','http://www.rishiinconline.com','https://soundcloud.com/rishiinc','http://www.reverbnation.com/#!/rishiinc','130189640337630','1861',0,NULL,1,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-10-09 16:09:11',330,'[\"\"]','[\"\"]','rishi-inc'),(446,2,1,1,'Hundred Octane','Rocking since 1993 and after several line up changes, we musicians have never surrendered to the hardest times and the saddest moments.

Leader of the Koteka Tribal Assembly, Benny Wenda was imprisoned by the Indonesian authorities for raising the banned \'Morning Star\' flag of West Papua, and for being an independence figurehead within West Papua. In 2003 he miraculously managed to escape from prison and was smuggled by freedom fighters through the jungle to neighbouring Papua New Guinea, where his wife Maria and their young child were by now living in a refugee camp by the border.

They were there for a one sole purpose: recording their second album with one of their favourite producers. This particular producer has worked with bands from the likes of And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead, JET, The Datsuns and The Dandy Warhols and rolls by the name of Chris \'Frenchie\' Smith.  \r\nHow they got here? Well, here\'s the tale of two youngsters chasing their dream in a far-away land.\r\n\r\nDuring the Great Depression of the 30’s, American blues hero Son House wrote and recorded his signature song “Death Letter”. Somewhat 76 years later in 2006, singer/guitarist Jordi “Duende” Ariza Lora (19 yrs old) and drummer Victor Brandt (18 yrs old) borrowed the name for their band, inspired by the song’s characteristic raw emotion and urgent rhythm. Also influenced by groups like The Thermals, Oceansize, Death Cab for Cutie, Cult of Luna and At The Drive-In, Death Letters aren’t even close to their twenties yet, but are already bursting with talent and growing experience. \r\n\r\nHitting it off immediately in their first rehearsal, Jordi and Victor became a tight musical pair and recorded their debut EP “Play it like you mean it” shortly afterwards. The EP was a success receiving excellent reviews.\r\nThings really kicked off when the guys, then aged 15 and 16, entered a band competition and made their first TV appearance. They went for gold and got it; a backstage gig at Holland’s finest summerfestival ‘Pinkpop’. With the media all over them it was time to get serious; that same year they recorded their first full-length album. \r\n\r\nAmsterdam based label Cool Buzz soon honed in on the Death Letters powerful sound and dynamic live performances, signed them in a heartbeat and released their debut self titled album in February 2009 throughout The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. The album delivers thirteen solid tracks drenched with rock, blues and a steep dose of punk boiled down to true grittiness written with blood, sweat and the occasional tear.\r\n \r\nGaining more attention with the release of the album, Death Letters began to tour a whole range of venues and festivals including Paradiso, Zwarte Cross and Paaspop, as well as several German stages. The Germans couldn’t get enough of the pair and so Death Letters teamed up with the Stagg-O-Lee Label (partner of the infamous Glitterhouse Records) to release the album in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. \r\n\r\nThe stage provides Death Letters with a free license to exalt untamed madness through their energetic live sets. Frontman Jordi literally jumps, flies, kicks and dives across the stage never compromising the integral performance of any song. His voice remains sturdy and sharp, his howls perfectly co-ordinating with his skills as a guitarist in spectacular licks. Now add Victor’s loud and incredibly taut drumming and you have a stage performance that impresses contemporaries and creates even more devoted followers.\r\n\r\nBut you will have to have just a little patience before the band will hit up the stages again. As mentioned Death Letters have just recorded their new album and are currently preparing its release for April 8th 2011. As the band develops, this second album will have a substantially different vibe, drawing more on a complex, psychedelic punk rock sound than the blues rock they started out with. \r\nWatch out for Death Letters – things are only going to get more intense from here..\r\n','info@lalalamanagement.nl','http://www.facebook.com/deathlettersmusic','http://www.deathletters.net','http://www.twitter.com/deathletters','','131612796865365','1775',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','death-letters'),(454,0,0,0,'Farhan Saeed','farhan saeed from pakistan who is a leading vocalist at jal the band.\r\n\r\nEducation status of farhan: Farhan acquired his early\r\neducation at Crescent\r\nfrom where he took his\r\nO levels.

They quit their jobs and said goodbye to their mummies, heading on an adventure to the incubator of melody – GOA.\r\n\r\nA good month of recording in a 150 year old Portuguese bungalow and another few months of playing the local Goan pubs got the Mavyns kick started on their musical journey to rockstardom. Cut back to Bombay where the Mavyns began playing the scene and sooner than you know it, completed a 4 city tour with the Supersonics playing 3 different HRC’s, released an album and got voted as most promising indie act of the year by indiecision.com. \r\n\r\nThe best way to describe their constantly evolving sound is to listen to it and if you do come up with a term for it, mail it to them. Seriously!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers:\r\n\r\nVivek \"Sex, Drugs and Rock & Roll\" Nair (Keys / Guitars / Vocals / Guy who turns the amps on and off) -     Vivek is the most anti-racist guy you will meet. For instance, he loves both the black and white keys on his piano equally. In fact, he has even named each and every one of them individually to make each feel special.\r\n\r\nBeing super duper smart, Vivek spends most of his time arguing and having intellectual debates with the only other fellow who can somewhat match wits with him - namely his reflection. Most of his love songs were written during those wonderfully emotional moments. He just changed the names later.\r\n\r\nHe hopes one day to own his own Dodo bird. He refuses to believe they are extinct. He also believes Elvis is alive and spends most of his free time in Goa trying to find him.\r\n\r\nVivek\'s dream is to invent a time machine, so he can finally return home to the ‘60s.\r\n\r\n\r\nPradeep \"Superstar\" Mathews (Lead Guitar/Vocals/Wah-Wah & Other funny noise maker) -     Pradeep is the \'blue-eyed boy\' of the band. Or is it green? We are not entirely sure. But we know for certain they do turn red after his regular jaunts to Aunty Mary\'s Bar.\r\n\r\nWhen not shredding solos for the Mavyns, Pradeep spends most of his time perusing his true dream in life - Winning the \'Bob Dylan International Karaoke Championship\'. The way he keeps practicing, we\'re sure it won\'t be long before he does.\r\n\r\nAn intellectual underachiever to the core, Pradeep is usually found contemplating the mysteries of life or trying to figure the sound of one hand clapping.\r\n\r\nHe also enjoys playing football and alligator wrestling, and has been known to dabble in other physically demanding sports like Snakes & Ladders and Ludo. One day Pradeep hopes they will name a guitar string after him, specifically the G-string.\r\n\r\n \r\nKristofor Paul \"Bad-Ass Chocolate Thunder\" Mendonca (Drummer /Percussionist, Vocals) -     When asked about what role he played in the band, Kris replied, “I hit things.” And that’s all he was gonna say about that.\r\n\r\nApart from band time, Kris enjoys long walks on the beach and candle light dinners. He also enjoys reading Shakespeare and listening to opera, especially the stuff sung by Pavarotti and the other two guys. Most times you will find Kris lying on his bed watching the fan spin round and round and round and round.\r\n\r\nAll in all, he is a really nice guy and has been unanimously voted by the other band members as - \"Most likely the one NOT to be arrested for possession of marijuana or dangerous weapons.\"\r\n\r\n \r\nVaroon “Drama Queen” Nair (Bass player / Vocals / Training Pilot / Roller of various items, excepting guitar cables) –     Varoon said he would hit me with his “man purse” if i didn’t mention that he studied at the same school as the great Freddy Mercury. Needless to say, Varoon is following Freddie’s footsteps in more ways than one. We don’t judge, we just create restraining orders.\r\n\r\nVaroon prides himself on being the only bassist who also plays harmonica. He also prides himself on his very toight buttocks, not to mention his ability to talk when no one is listening.\r\n\r\nVaroon spends most of his free time finger painting and coming up with new ways to plug the hole in the ozone layer.\r\n\r\nOne day Varoon hopes to open his own music shop in Antarctica.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTimothy \"I\'ll-make-you-an-offer-you-can\'t-refuse\" Lobo - (Band Manager/Image Consultant/Sushi Connoisseur/BBQ King)\r\n\r\nFresh out of college, Timmy was sent on a trip to sell Refrigerators to Eskimos. One week later, he had everyone buying not just a new refrigerator, but a central air conditioner, matching socks, ready-made iced tea sachets and a two-humped camel as well.\r\n\r\nA true environmentalist and a very talented chef, he helped delay global warming by creating a 5 bean salad, without any beans. An unshakable champion and defender of human rights, he almost single handedly ended child labor in most third world countries by teaching monkeys to stitch sneakers. \r\n\r\nLooking for a fresh new challenge, he has taken over as manager of the Mavyns and has already started showcasing the most essential part of being a legendary manager - throwing awesomely unforgettable BBQ’s. Unfortunately, he tends to eat a little more than the usual 15% commission when it comes to the food, something that really needs to be reviewed on the contract.\r\n\r\nOne day, he hopes to bring back LP\'s and bell-bottoms. He also hopes to figure out how much wood a woodchuck can chuck if a wood chuck can chuck wood.\r\n','themavyns@gmail.com/Padeep Mathews: 9769406422','http://www.facebook.com/themavyns','','','http://www.reverbnation.com/themavyns','198843090284','1745',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','the-mavyns'),(460,0,2,2,'SummerPint jUNKie','','','http://www.facebook.com/SummerPintjUNkie',' http://www.myspace.com/summerpintjunkie','','','133582945094','1745',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','summerpint-junkie'),(461,0,3,3,'Bevar Sea','','bevarsea@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/bevarsea','http://bevarsea.bandcamp.com/','','','142638672416103','1735',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','bevar-sea'),(462,0,1,1,'DJ VBV','The shaking world of music at present doesn’t see any barrage.

Later Dylan Perera Played guitars for a few months he chose to leave the band due to personal issues. \r\n  \r\nAfter a disagreement within the band, Udugampola left in late 2010 and has made various attempts to bring the name of Dhishti to disrepute. After Udugampola\'s betrayal, Kirindage has taken up the mantle of bassist and Alles was incorporated into the ranks of Dhishti in December 2010 for a landmark tour within the Black Metal history of two countries: Dhishti toured Mumbai, India and performed at the first ever  Black Metal Fest in India; The Black Metal Kreig, 2010.

We base our music in the ominous and monotonous sounds of Black Metal, splicing it together with generations of acutely honed ancient Sri Lankan music to produce a truly unique sound for which the band is known. Screeching, ululating vocals pouring forth blasphemous lyrics filled with pure rage, hatred and pain accompanied by sighing guitars and powerful bass being supplemented by the steady drone of consistent drums with uniquely identifiable rolls and breaks would describe the characteristics seen up to now in music which Dhishti.

With their complicated and messed up (read: varied) roots as a huge strength, they tackle material that is irreverent, sexy, disrespectful and always very groovy.\r\n\r\n A deep love for the songwriting traditions of the old school funk and disco of the 70s-80s combined with a modern outlook and sense of sound design, veering towards nu-jazz and a fair degree of rock and roll, held together by a double guitar attack, are what make one part of the sound. Aided by basslines set in the heart of disco and funky percussions and violin, lyrics are a major point of focus, and songwriting is key to the band’s vision for a revival or a modern take on this classic ‘black power’ sound.    \r\n\r\nHow do you try and control a complicated country with dozens of languages and intense situations? Answer: you don’t. You just dance and celebrate the complications! The only sensible thing left to do in this scene with people judging and mudslinging each other, is to dance baby! And make people dance.\r\n\r\nExpect some seriously high energy sets, with disco style bass, groovy pockets, some jazz coloured mode playing, and tongue in cheek lyrics that have no respect for genre and culture divisions.  \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n*******','thepulpsociety@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/thepulpsociety','http://www.myspace.com/thepulpsociety ','http://www.soundcloud.com/thepulpsociety','','451816530005','1673',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','the-pulp-society'),(474,0,0,0,'Clubfeet','','','http://www.facebook.com/HelloClubfeet','','','','195378643840801','1669',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','clubfeet'),(475,0,3,3,'Verses','VerseS debuted in 2008 through various inter-collegiate gigs.

In the year 2007, they came out with their first offering in the form of a 9 song album titled Chaos Sessions. This album was recorded with a guitar processor completely self made by the band for a megre 150 bucks, since the band couldn’t afford enough cash with their pocket money.\r\n\r\nPost completion of their degrees, Dark Project re-grouped and re-shuffled it’s lineup. Amidst all the adversity, they did not want to stop the production mill and came out with their second full length album titled as Liberty & Entropy in the year\r\n2009. The album was eventually reviewed by the Rolling Stone Magazine, Rock Street Journal, IndiarockMp3, Indiescion and was also released on iTunes and Amazon for the worldwide audience. The band followed it up with shows in Some Place Else, Opus and the Pub Rock Fest in the same year.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a hiatus for 2 years that involved a bassist change and a relocation of the band to Bangalore. The band made a comeback into the Independent circuit with it’s two latest offerings – Magic and Tale of the Liars in July this year(2011).\r\n\r\nDark Project is not just a band, it\'s a relationship that has survived, struggled and bruised through the odds for the last 6 years.

Kaav’s song ‘Daya’ represented India in the international Indie Music Compilation Album MAP (Music Alliance Project) comprising 35 countries which was featured by ‘The Guardian’ UK. Kaav’s video for the song ‘Daya’ was featured on Coldplay’s official website in September 2010. Kaav’s EP was given a rating of 4/5 by MyOpus Radio  and the band was also featured by leading newspapers such as the Times, Indian Express and Mathrubhoomi. \r\n\r\nAfter the immense success of the debut EP Kaav is scheduled to record a full length album by March 2011. Kaav’s usual set list comprises of ten plus songs which include the songs featured in the EP and other compositions which may make it to the upcoming album. Kaav has been playing gigs around Kerala and is planning to tour rest of the country soon.\r\n\r\nThe band is based in Vypin Island, Kerala, India. The seclusion of the place brings several limitations. But the natural beauty and the coastal lifestyle have an immense influence on the nature of the band’s music. Kaav’s music draws influences from Indian classical & Folk music, Rock, Metal, World Music, Jazz Fusions, Blues, Prog, Psy and Alternative.\r\n\r\nThe word ‘Kaav’ was taken from ‘Kaavu’ or ‘Kaavukal’ which in Malayalam means the traditional shrines, forests where so many folk stories, art forms like ‘Theyyam’, ‘Koodiyatam’ etc. originated. Fears, mysteries, superstitions, religion and spirituality were always associated with Kaav which is also the meeting place of the human psyche.\r\n\r\n\'Kaav\' in Media\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n“This Vypin Island trio appeared out of nowhere this year and quietly defined something very important for music in India – you don’t need a tabla, a sitar or even a vocalist to make music steeped in Indian-ness.

The original line-up included Roshan Roy on the drums, Abhijeet Saniyal on the bass, Mridul Luthra on the lead guitar and Adityan Nair on the vocals. Later Siby Mathew, a dear friend of Mridul, was introduced as the rhythm guitarist and the band started jamming under the temporary name \"The Chawla Band\". Siby\'s introduction to the band encouraged the psychedelic influence in the music that the band made that primarily intended to be a funk/alternative band.

With varying musical influences within the band members, AVR’s sound is a mixture of conventional musical arrangement with ambient textures, aiming at creating a virtual ‘wall of sound’. There is an emphasis of music being the real source of the cycles/waves that AVR aims at taking it’s listeners through and hence there is more emphasis on expression through music, which is more dominant in their sound than vocals.\r\n\r\nSince the Lineup change, AVR nas setteld into their current sound, though the band feels that musical evolution, as with life, is a constant part of their existance.

It’s repercussions, even severe. These four catholic boys are now on a mission to save the church from the impious hands that raise the chalice.

A brave new front fighting against the pretense of preachers while making every parochial house dance to their tunes of their hymns. The purpose: To serve the Lord with all their heart and their weapon of choice: ‘sound’. For the past two and a half years, these missionaries have led the crusade by touching the lives of people across the country. \r\n\r\nIt’s been a journey that has borne witness to the communion of four God-fearing souls. With Michael Lee pounding an ‘all-strings-attack’ on the stained glasses of corruption.  Ruel Barretto, slapping the faces of the stiff-upper-lipped with some flavour-filled funk. Keegan Pereira, sermonizing the congregation with candid confessions of a catholic rebel. Levin Mendes, exorcizing the demons out of the monastery while pounding those tribal beats.

Arguably one of the most eclectic metal bands around, Bhoomi have since gigged extensively all over India building a reputation as one of the most enthralling live acts to have surfaced from the rising metal scene in the country.\n\nWith their roots firmly entrenched in the classic metal of Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Queensryche and other seminal hard rock and metal bands of the 80\'s, Bhoomi are arguably one of the finest exponents of pure, melodic metal anyone is likely to find. Using traditional hard rock and metal as their base, Bhoomi stand out from the crowd with their unique incorporation of three way vocal harmonies into their music, which instantly gives them an identity and sound that is all their own. Throw in some classy songwriting and technical prowess into the mix and you have a band that can make you bang your head with pounding riffs and dazzle you with a catchy and superlatively melodic chorus before you get a chance to catch your breath. Another aspect of the band that has further endeared them to their fans is their lyrical stance,which rages against corruption and champions the cause of the common man.\n\nWith more than 200 gigs under their belt since their inception and a fully developed and mature sound, 2010 promises to be the year that puts Bhoomi on the international map with acclaimed grammy nominated producer Neil Kernon (Nevermore, Queensryche) set to work with the band to release their highly anticipated debut album on an unsuspecting world.','Srinivas V T','http://www.facebook.com/metalbhoomi','','','','138717726169011','1365',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','bhoomi-1'),(545,0,0,0,'I Quit','Once upon another time, four friends were sitting in a lawn; they were agitated by the power cut, mosquito bites and Gig’s headache.\nSuddenly Tau said ‘I Quit’, he was fed up of playing off beats in the band, as they were obsessed with it!\n\nTau, a self taught Haryanavi bassist, always inspire band to make simple note to note music but Sushil being musically illiterate, always makes it a bit  complicated.\nSo Tau’s words turned out to be the band’s name later.\n\nWell talking about ‘I quit’, it’s a punk rock band from Chandigarh, consist of four fucking PIA’s\nWho always quit easy ways to do things and get themselves in troubled ways all the time.\nHere they lie, disgracefully:\n\n\n1.

There was, as most bands see, that one miraculous jam that brings them together. Like everything else in life this too was and is still a process and it has taken time and effort on our part to get where ever we are and today, through a continuous struggle, for recognition and more of an effort to find ourselves through the music and the music changing as we slowly discovered how we worked together.\n  \nSome say our music is ambient and some say its loud and other say it doesn’t make any sense, well all of this is true; the music that we produce is a living-breathing thing, a person that we build together. Sometimes it looks ken and Barbie the epitome of human perfection (which is a distant dream for us) and most of the time and generally resembling Frankenstein and Dolly Singh. \n\nIn the middle the band went through a rough phase, our drummer, Sarthak Kapoor was forced to leave the band. He was the backbone, in almost every sort of way. For us the band was coming to an end even before it started, our performance graph was one that was steadily rising and with his departure we really thought we were done for. In the interim period before Ruttajeet Mukherjee joined us and we were able to regroup and work, we played with a couple of drummers. One of them told us that the way we made music was very different and very interesting. He told us that, Abeer – the bassist, would bring the skeleton while Saksham, on guitars, would give him his flesh nerves and basic features, and Sahej, through his dynamic vocal range would give him thoughts and a voice so he can scream and profess his love for all the decadent things in life and all the lewd and crude things we indulge in so freely. The drummer the last addition to the mix would give him locomotion, freedom of his arms and legs to roam and see the world so he can have an opinion, so he can learn to dance and walk around and run away from home to join the circus. Ruttajeet, or who is better known as reet, does just that.\nWe don’t believe in the classic verse- chorus- verse song structure, we make music, and the world is our canvas. Our sound is our sound in every sort of way, we make it and we break it. \nThe deal for us is very simple and here I want to be as honest with you as I can. The music scene in India is very small and the number of people who actually get up and come for the shows are very small, and to become renown is very tough. The opportunity for upward mobility is very small and often studded with obstacles, which most bands can’t over come. We the soundscape don’t care very much for upward mobility and the obstructs to progress, what we care about is making our little place where ever we are in the social ladder and if people like us well and good if not then there is little one can do about it. The only thing is we want something to motivate us and push us and that till now has been our sound and I guess always will be, the opportunity to build upon and change it, strip it down and recast it and make it look like our perception of the world, is something that drives us. What we would call, true artistic aspirations.\n\nWe have reached the finals in a couple competitions and won one. But that doesn’t matter. It really doesn’t matter how many articles have been published and how many times we’ve come in the newspaper. It really doesn’t matter how many likes we have on Facebook what matters at the end of the day, that you who would have read this and gone through this slightly confusing piece would listen to our song and like it. \n\n\n \"You, me and \'us\' is all that is all to the world. We are very much part of the world and so are you, together we are us. The sound is slightly louder and slightly softer, the range that is beyond a genre but we try.

In 9th grade i was enrolled into G.W. Carver High school. this is where my love for music grew enormously and the fire that is my passion was lit. i learned how to play guitar while attending Carver and i have never put it down since then. it took me about six months to get the basics down, like chords and chord changes and rhythms. Nowadays i listen to everything ranging from Rock to hip hop to all types of music.....some of my favorite bands are Trivium, KSE, Alterbridge and Breaking Benjamin to name a few. Some of my Influences Would be Mark Tremonti (The MACHINE!!!!!!), Matt Heafy, Jim Root, Synester Gates, Carlos Santanna and Michael Angelo Batio.

I\'ve always played with Alejandro, first with\'the Fatboi\', then with the Sean and Rox.  Irv, aka \"El Sabor\" Lira came along and cemented the deal. badass drums, in-your-head, melodic riffage, and guitar solos. What more could I want? The people who shaped the way I feel out the bass are Mike McCullough, Arif Mirabdolbaghi, Gustavo Dal Farra, Mike D\'Antonio, Ryan Martinie, and a long list of other great guys on the ass end of the sonic palette.

Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. It is more challenging to write a page about oneself than it seems at first. People tend to say some peculiar things when they describe themselves or their lives; some try too hard, some make fools out of themselves. I will try my best not to make the same mistakes, however, also remember that reading this is voluntary. So here it goes: \n\nI’ve been a busy chappy as of late though… work load is creeping up again, along with socializing, driving, dancing, music and majorly sleeping….\n\n\"Call me Amogh. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely, nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.\" Since the quote, ever so perfectly, captures my state of mind while having left my home country and exploring the New World, I decided to have it as the opening sentence on my profile. I have been told that I have a colorful personality and perhaps that is why my friends have given me more nicknames. Each nickname has its own saga to go with it. However, for those who are not familiar with the stories, \"Amogh\" works fine.\n\nForemost, I would consider myself a very modest person. Nevertheless, if I would absolutely have to promote myself, which certainly should be the case when writing one’s own profile, I could borrow some of the adjectives that my friends have used when describing me: \"friendly, ambitious, unique, fun, lovable, crazy, frank, honest” among some others. O, and did I already mention \"sexy”?.\n\nI would like to pay tribute to all the wonderful friends that I have around me. I share many incredible memories with these friends and I am looking forward to many more adventures, as I will be preparing myself for the adventurous life that is lying ahead of me. My friends are one of the most important aspects of my life and I try treating every single one of them accordingly. \"Treat others the way you want to be treated\" - my motto. I wish that more people lived by my motto.\n\nI am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful oceans while flying. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies.I like Rock Music, I like remix songs I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh. Sometimes I like to be romantic and keep staring at the rainbow, smelling the first rain and listening to rain drops. I like the sound of guitar strings when it’s played in silence.\n\nMy goal of life is to try experience all the wildest things in life (defining \"wild\" is up to you) and never look back or regret about anything. I like to dream a lot and challenge myself to fulfill them. I always wanted to be an Disc Jockey for its passion and hard-work which helps earn self-respect. I also dreamed of going crazy on the road and driving fast as I can. I like to make my parents proud. I want to walk on the footsteps of persons who have immense desire and courage to change this world. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who likes to help people with care and gentle smile, some love, and some care.

Born in Mumbai, Reji was bitten by the music bug during the mid-90s. After collecting loads of music cassettes, CDs & vinyl in his youth, in 1998 he decided to give DJing a shot by learning from veteran DJ, Jo Azaredo. Since that year, there has been no stopping for this multifaceted wizard as today, Reji is one of the most prolific names in Mumbai\'s booming alternative & electronic music scene.\r\n\r\nFor the longest time in his career, Reji has been recognized as an educator within the music fraternity. After understanding India\'s unique music scene in the early 2000s, the DJ professor designed & implemented his own syllabus at some of the best DJ schools in the city; training more than 500 men & women in the art of DJing, turntablism & music production. By putting his mouth where the money is, Reji has been a successful battle DJ by winning the DMC Champion (Pune - 2000), Times War of the DJs winner (Mumbai - 2007) & Kingfisher Ultra DJ (2010) titles through the years. Reji was the first ever turntablist in an Indian nu-age metal band called Scag and also the brains behind India\'s earliest hip hop collective called \"itch\". In December 2008, world renowned travel magazine, Time Out Mumbai, mentioned him as “one of Mumbai\'s most influential DJs\" in its cover article. Reji has also been promoting fresh talent & sounds through his DIY One Sunday nights (2008-2009) & through his current role as a label DJ/promoter/talent scout for Air Snare Records.\r\n\r\nrayG is an alternative side project (read alter ego) of Reji Ravindran. Under this moniker he is known for dishing out a whole different spectrum of music where he fuses his turntablism skills with eclectic beats & breaks (irrespective to tempos, genres & styles). His vast knowledge & interesting music selections have got him gig bookings within India\'s elite music, art & fashion circles. This also helped him clinch the resident DJ title at Mumbai\'s hippest nightspot, Bonobo, since early 2011. By always keeping an emphasis on quality music with longer shelf life (minus short term crass commercial appeal), you can always expect Reji to dish out an unpredictable blend of indie, reggae, rock, dub, dance hall, funk, soul, breaks, disco, baltimore, classic house/prog house/tribal house/techno, hip hop, electro, drum n bass/jungle, swing, retro, dub step, mash ups & much more....

Initially we had Abhishek on the BASS. We had named ourselves as \'\'CYCLONIC CHAOS\'\', but later on Abhishek had to leave the SUCKAZ to make his life MORE WORTHY!! And then the band almost went out of trace for almost 3-4 months ,until Saurav befriended The EARSPLIT\'s, Anshul, and allured him to join the scene..!! Back then the multitalented Anshul was on a hunt for a secondary project, and he almost formed some other band ,but thanks to some CRAZY incidents this dream was sort’ov left undone.  Mean while when Mr.Saurav was too busy sleeping or chatting all day long and randomly changing the name of his AIR BAND , Anshul showed some interest in being the third idiot in his VISIONARY PROJECT..!! Hence Saurav agreed and assured Anshul all the NAME, FAME and most primarily the CHIKAZ in the world (i.e. in the TOWN).\nSo the bands final 3-piece lineup came about in DECEMBER 2009 and we got the chance to make a fool of ourselves for the first time in FEBRUARY 2010 in the hometown itself. Impressed by our weirdness another SUCKA named Shubham approached us to join the band and therefore with a 4-piece lineup we were back on stage in June,2010.\nAfter this, to add drama in the sucker\'s group, Anshul decided to leave the band for the betterment of his primary project THE EARSPLIT, and we stood \'\'baseless\'\' for an entire year, doing nothing except nosepicking!\nAnd then after an entire year of dramatic seclusion, Gaurav woke up and came to the rescue by introducing 2 newest members to the gang....with Dikshit (on Bass), and Fat Shady (on Rhythms). The band once again rose and performed in 5 different stages in less than a month and set a \'\'world record\'\' for themselves in their own little world!!\n\nWith a lot of ups and downs and some edited line ups here we are today, with only a few gigs done and NO SATISFACTION , all bankrupted, girlfriends turning to EX-girlfriends, hearts stitched with nylon strings, and young boys turning to \'\'lameted\'\' businessmen!!\n\nBut we\'re RESPECTED (in our own lil\' world), and that’s what matters.  \nYO!!

Their influences range from bands like Parkway Drive, August Burns Red, For The Fallen Dreams and Hatebreed to bands like Meshuggah, Gojira, Textures and Tesseract.

That palpable dichotomy inhabits his music, as illustrated by his captivating international debut album Bada Boom – to be released on November 16th, 2010 by Abstract Logix.\nAs a writer and producer, Barot honed his skills by crafting songs and scores for the thriving, prolific Indian film scene and working closely with other artists. Although capable on a range of instruments, his weapon of choice as a performer remains the western drum kit, on which he has cultivated a unique voice that internalizes and refracts his musical and cultural influences. As a drummer, he has performed alongside such formidable improvising composer/instrumentalists as John McLaughlin, Ustad Zakir Hussain, Pandit Ravi Shankar, Charlie Mariano and Don Cherry. \n\nThe son of the legendary Indian classical dancer Sitara Devi (who specialized in the Northern Indian Kathak style), Barot was raised in a musically rich environment. His home played frequent host to jam sessions, where formidable musicians would gather to stretch out, experiment, and freely explore their art. He was drawn to the drum set at age 12, and despite the fact that the trap set is a western instrument, he was nurtured and supported by those around him. By the time he was seventeen, Barot was one of the leading drummers in India, equally inspired by the music around him and the fusion revolution happening in the west – all without any formal training on the instrument. After an extended period working in studios and drumming rarely, the past decade has found him reinvesting himself as an instrumentalist, resulting in a series of high-profile performance opportunities, including his participation in John McLaughlin’s stunning 2008 album Floating Point, which featured McLaughlin alongside a cast of stellar Indian fusion musicians. \n\nCiting the pathbreaking music of Mahavishnu Orchestra and Shakti, Ranjit counts McLaughlin and Zakir Hussain as two of his biggest influences – a respect that is reciprocated as McLaughlin contributes a blistering solo to Bada Boom’s opening track, “Singularity,” and Zakir Hussain provides the driving force for “Supernova.” Composed of four original pieces and two striking reinventions of traditional Indian themes, Bada Boom brilliantly explores Barot’s musical and cultural dichotomy. Rather than simply recast one culture in the guise of another – transposing tabla parts onto the drum set, playing funk guitar licks on the veena, etc. – Barot composes and arranges provocative, thoughtful dialogues from which these varied influences, textures, and techniques eventually emerge as one voice. “The meeting point of all art is the same, at least to me,” Barot concludes. “When you strip away things like genre, ethnicity, art form even, then you are left with just intent and spirit.”\n\n','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ranjit-Barot/142525269120380','','','','142525269120380','1106',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','ranjit-barot'),(612,0,0,0,'Captain Crunch & the Naina Kundu Trio','Floyd Fernandes  is a progressive blues rock guitar player who has played in numerous setups in and around Mumbai.

A band was formed with 5 people in it from 3 different Engineering institutes: IIT KGP, Jadavpur University and HIT, Haldia.\n\nDark Project is an English band that composes music that can be classified as an eclectic blend of Alternative and Progressive Rock.Using their proficiency with “technology” that they got as a freebee as a part of their Degrees, Dark Project slowly started recording songs adopting a complete DIY philosophy. In the year 2007, they came out with their first offering in the form of a 9 song album titled Chaos Sessions. This album was recorded with a guitar processor completely self made by the band for a megre 150 bucks, since the band couldn’t afford enough cash with their pocket money.\n\nPost completion of their degrees, Dark Project re-grouped and re-shuffled it’s lineup. Amidst all the adversity, they did not want to stop the production mill and came out with their second full length album titled as Liberty & Entropy in the year\n2009. The album was eventually reviewed by the Rolling Stone Magazine, Rock Street Journal, IndiarockMp3, Indiescion and was also released on iTunes and Amazon for the worldwide audience. The band followed it up with shows in Some Place Else, Opus and the Pub Rock Fest in the same year.\n\nThis was followed by a hiatus for 2 years that involved a bassist change and a relocation of the band to Bangalore. The band made a comeback into the Independent circuit with it’s two latest offerings – Magic and Tale of the Liars in July this year(2011).\n\nDark Project is not just a band, it\'s a relationship that has survived, struggled and bruised through the odds for the last 6 years. Even with a limited English music listener base in the country, the band wants to inspire people through their work as they prepare themselves up for a mission that only reads - Follow your dreams, no matter how bad the situations get, feel the \'Magic\' that happens because of it.','','http://www.facebook.com/RedEnergyDarkProject','','','','162108877217903','1059',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','redenergydarkproject'),(626,0,0,0,'_{ TaKe OfF __','','+91-7696355241','http://www.facebook.com/takeofftheband','','','','168406859844721','1059',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','take-off'),(627,0,0,0,'Aisha Ali','','ali.aisha123@gmail.com,9886221133','http://www.facebook.com/AishaAli12','','','','189437607760963','1056',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','aisha-ali'),(628,0,0,0,'Moksh','Moksh started off as a college band in a small city called Davangere, Karnataka, India, which was formed to perform at one of the college festival in the year 2007.

The music is Folk / Blues / Alt. Rock / Experimental\n\nRony Jose (Vocals/Harmonica/Guitar) \n\nOne of the original members of the band, he is back after a year long sabbatical. And he is better  than ever. The voice of the band, he even plays the harmonica and guitar if he is in the mood. Performing live gives him the ultimate high. He can be found around anything and anyone related to music and art, and spends his time sketching, drawing or making music on the software. An avid traveler, for him, playing music in new places is a step closer to nirvana.\n\n\nAkash Sharma (Guitar/Vocals/Synth)\n\nIt was the magic in music that drove him to form the Travelling River Band. His expertise lies in composing music and his first love is his guitar. A passionate sound engineer, he believes in using technology to the fullest when it comes to recording, postproduction and band rehearsals. His bedroom studio is testimony to his love for sound. When not online exploring the latest gadgets, or recording, he can be found with his second love, his bike. He loves riding to unknown destinations, the plains, the hills, nothing is beyond reach and he always takes the longer routes. Despite being a recluse, he is surprisingly the most socially active person in the band. Also, he is also the one man solution to all your IT problems. \n\n\nAsit Adsul (Keyboard/Vocals) \n\nMusic flows through his genes; his grandfather is Pt DP Adsul, the noted khayal singer. The strong family musical culture opened him up to classical music from a young age. His inputs are valuable when it comes to fine tuning a note or a rhythm in a track. The flute is his companion of choice, keeping him busy quite often. Inspiration for him comes from long drives usually to a serene riverside or a calm beach.\n\nJack Saha (Bass/Vocals)\n\nOnce a lead guitarist; he has come a long way from the hills of Darjeeling to the congested streets of Mumbai and picked up bass during this journey. In Mumbai he has been part of bands that have played everything from gospel music to Hindustani classical. He normally gives a single take while recording, and very rarely struggles with melody and bass lines. He rarely complains and prefers to go with the mood and flow of the song. His improvisations add a rustic flavor to the band’s compositions. \n\n\nManas Baruah (Drums/Sampler)\n\nAt the age of 10, he got his first drum kit, starting off a love story with percussions that has endured to this day. The time spent in the concert circuit in and around Assam and Mumbai has given him musical influences from hard rock, jazz and pop to progressive and funk.A lesser known fact is that he is a fabulous cook. He is also highly possessive about his electronic drum kit and could kill for it.

Formerly known as Atharva, Sidharth and Goldy began rehearsing as a two-piece band with Sidharth on vocals and keyboards and Goldy on Guitars. Sidharth\'s black metal influences and Goldy\'s Melodic Metal influences merged to form Corrode. \n\nCorrode\'s music has been consistent with no shift in genre from the time of the band’s inception. Harsha Neelakantan joined the band as the bassist in the winter of 2007. Sidharth, Goldy and Harsha had been the permanent members of Corrode which as a band has had quite a few line-up changes! A few of Corrode\'s ex-band members are - Jayanth (Guitars; who is currently the endorsement engineer for the biggest band in India - Kryptos), Rijo (Drums), Shreyas (Drums), Manish (Guitars) and Yash (Drums).\n\nIn March 2009, Ashwin Alexander (drums, Sptifire and ex-Macabre Intent) and Benjamin (Crucifix Guide, ex-Macabre Intent) joined the band to complete Corrode\'s five-piece line-up. The band played at many college fests and local gigs. In May 2009, Goldy suffered a severe neck injury while performing on stage which put him out of action for a couple of months. This resulted in a temporary break for Corrode. After Goldy recovered, he continued with his side project, Nihilus along with Harsha on bass guitar, Sidharth on drums and Amar (Clipped Wing Satellite and Venator) on vocals. In December 2009, Sidharth announced his departure from Nihilus and Corrode, consequently disbanding Nihilus and further extending Corrode\'s break.\n\nIn April 2010, after nearly a year of hiatus, Corrode was revived when Nikil Kumar (bass, ex-Macabre Intent) and Aditya Rajan (vocals, ex-Macabre Intent) joined the band. Harsha shifted to guitar to fill the void formed when Benjamin went on to join Crucifix Guide, thus once again completing Corrode\'s five-piece line up.\n\nIn September 2010, Harsha left Corrode to pursue his studies in Philadelphia, USA. Aditya took his place on guitars and a new vocalist- Achish Jeremiah was added to the band for a short period of time, till his departure in March 2011 due to musical differences.\n\nThe band with its present line-up (four-piece for the first time since its inception),  is going steady, and is in the process of writing and producing their debut album with a distinct and more melodic sound as compared to the singles formerly released.

But much before he paved his way into the world of entertainment, he experienced a humble upbringing in a small town in the north of India – Roorkee. Roorkee, famous for its Engineering College, was the perfect cultural hub he could have found. It was during his college years in Bhopal that Ankur began writing the relaxed, acoustic-based songs that would later find their place in his debut Album – ‘Jannat’. Right after college he took a sharp turn to the road of storytelling - songwriting being a major feature in that. He spent the formative years in Delhi working under the likes of Col Kapoor, Bobby Bedi and Shekhar Kapoor. He also paired up with his friend Siddharth Anand Kumar to direct and write his first feature – ‘Let’s Enjoy’. His song from the movie – ‘Sabse Peeche Hum Khade’, became an underground hit across the sub continent. He struggled hard to find a label in the ‘dark and convenient era of remixes.’ He wanted a pure live acoustic sound for his album and it was tough convincing the suits. It was only when the ANR at HOM records heard him strumming his minimalist melodies that Ankur eventually found what he had been looking for. They backed him in his vision and he ended up recording his album with music producers Tino Francorsi in Mumbai and Xulfi in Lahore. The recording of the album led to film OST projects – ‘Raat Gayi Baat Gayi’ & ‘Aao Wish Karien’. He was nominated in the ‘Best Upcoming Music Director’ category at the Mirchi Music Awards 2010. At the live circuit he plays with his four-piece band – ‘Ankur & the Ghalat Family’. The sound of his band ranges from Urdu/ Hindi Rock n’ Roll to easy acoustic ballads & folk rock.','+91-9819-257-005','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ankur-The-Ghalat-Family/102360416490973','http://www.myspace.com/ankur.tewari','','','0','999',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','ankur-the-ghalat-family'),(649,0,0,0,'Pseutopia','Pseutopia pursues its path to create hard hitting music that is bound to provoke your thoughts while it kicks your ass.

The context in which the band lives is characterized by a society that basically ignores the extreme music. This because of limited chances the town itself offers, here’s what fed the desire of “screaming” a message against a wrong reality that doesn’t pass unnoticed to the eye target that only the truth can perceive.\n\nSo two friends, Enrico La Corte (drums) and Luca Delfino (vocals), who previously had shared together this philosophy, decided to bring about this new project in which he was immediately involved Gianluca \"Ske\" Schepis (guitar) and later Vittorio Ziino (bass) who was a childhood friend of Enrico.

An year later, in 2010, the band members had found a very talented young drummer Aniketh, barely 13 years old, completing the band lineup.\nFrom there on, the band has been actively involved in composing their own tracks, experimenting with all sort of genre.\n\nTheir first song titled \'bodhane\' has been a huge hit, though recorded as a demo version, on the Internet.It is a song touching the depth of spiritual awareness that actually touched the tastes of many  rock lovers.\n\nThe band eventually came up with their second hit \'kanna mucchale\' which describes the turmoils of the transition from childhood to adulthood. It was only an acoustic version recorded by sujith and amyth which took the band  among the top five on reverbnation.\nThe band later came out with a rock devotional song dedicated to lord ganesha which was brilliantly improvised by the band mates and gained huge accolades when they played it live at kyra, bangalore.\nThe band have also been concentrating on social issues like current politics, the position of Indian farmers and so, for which the songs have been worked out.\n\nThe band\'s founder member Amyth (19) has been a guitarist since 2008 and is pretty well known for playing at several live performances throughout bangalore.

His dream to revolutionize rock in kannada was fulfilled by his brother Sujith, and his band mates Ruthvi and Aniketh. Today he is the lead guitarist and also a composer who also provides backing vocals to Vichitra.\n\nAmyth and the band co-founder Ruthvi (16), met at battle of the bands 10, and discovered they had similar interest and their dream of building a kannada rock band was further strengthened. Ruthvi a student from Jain college also plays and composes for the band. He also works on music projects, plays and composes for Primal Theory with Aniketh, the drummer of Vichitra too.\n\nThough he seems little, he can never be underestimated with a sheer amount of talent he displays.

With those deceptive innocent eyes, nobody can guess that this kid is capable of also playing keyboard, guitar,tabla, mrudanga and also classical instruments.

During his college days, he has also collaborated with his friends and made his own movies and finds huge interests in the field of script writing and cinema.

At that time, it played stuffs from Napalm Death and their then original numbers – ‘War Cry’, ‘Resurrection’ and ‘Rape of Democracy’.\n\nUnfortunately, after a couple of months, the band had to split ways to pursue higher education which resulted in the exit of its guitarist and bassist. After a hiatus of two months, the band reformed with Xulfi on bass, Bikash on guitars and Abhishek on keyboards. With this new line-up being heavily influenced by some Symphonic Black Metal acts like Dimmu Borgir, Cradle of Filth, etc, the band changed its genre to Symphonic Black Metal which also resulted in discarding all of their previous original numbers and started covering songs from the said genre.\n\nThen there a time came when Parvez and Abhishek walked out from the band and with their exit, Insane Prophecy fluctuated from Symphonic Black Metal to Black Metal with Valefar joining in on vocals. On basis of its new sound, i.e, Black Metal, Insane Prophecy recorded its first single – ‘Blasphemy ov a Diabolic’.. Their sound clearly concentrates on stuffs from Norwegian Black Metal fused with other Death Metal sub-genres. They combine the sound perfectly with Black Metal elements full of blast-beats, scratching riffs with screams and Death metal growls and groovy guitar riffing alongwith some sturdy and melodic bass lines. With the new sound, the band also started following up more extreme metal bands such as Immortal, Behemoth, Belphegor etc. Ifty writes all the lyrics, drums and vocal patterns, whereas Xulfi and Bikash write their respective music.  \n\nSubsequently, Valefar quit the band, which led Insane Prophecy to be a three-piece outfit with Ifty & Xulfi doing Vocals along with Drums and Bass respectively & Bikash on Guitars which is presumed to be the permanent line-up of the band. \n\nTheir song, ‘Blasphemy ov a Diabolic’ got featured in Episode 13 of the Flaming Skull Metalcast which also featured an interview with Galder (Guitarist) Dimmu Borgir.

It was a very dry summer when (now ex) bassist Bharat and Srijan met for an informal jam at a CCD outlet. And this went on for every weekend until, pushed beyond even their remarkable tolerance, the good people frequenting the outlet begged them to stop the strangling cats and get a job or something. Huh!!! But SOON, they realized their mistake as the band went all (over) India, with receving le Cafe Coffee Day Grammie 2008 for the best Rock group....\n\nAnyway, time went by and the duo kept wondering whether to form a band at all or just play with the gold already received. They met a few drummers who didn\'t quite cut it, but did  kick-start with an old drummer friend. With hardly any practice, LC were  invited to participate in Independence Rock XXIII. Not their best gig. Pro - the band were called \"hawt\" by some chixs in the crowd, LC learned NEVER to cover Nickelback again, and the audience got to know about this oh so bright band from Delhi. \n\nThe next gigs were in Cafe Morrison (Delhi), Hard Rock Cafe, (Mumbai), and Independence Rock XXIV. LC went on to perform at quite a few College fests around the country, most recently headlining the D-School Annual Fest in Delhi 2010.\n\nLC\'s USP is simple. We are baby Green Day. We get that a lot and honestly we kinda like it. Our antics, style, and even fashion sense owe a lot to their influence.  But we\'re SLIGHTLY novel when it comes music.  While influenced by Green Day, it\'s still unique when it comes to our own songs. So, if you don\'t like us at all then go cry your heart out to Green Day. If they weren\'t alive and kicking neither would we, so you know who to blame. We;re trying to develop our versatiliy as well.

Eines der schönen Dinge, im Jahr 2010 zu leben.\nNehmen wir Christoph Beck alias Joasihno, den seine Freunde im Übrigen Cico nennen.\nEr ist ein Produkt aus dem Umstand, dass Grenzen - wenn überhaupt - nur noch da existieren, wo man sie selber zieht.  Internet sei Dank. Reisen sei Dank.\nUnd  im gleichen Moment ist Joasihno einer, der diese Grenzen verwischt.\nZu abstrakt? Lasst uns konkret werden:\nEin junger Musiker aus einem kleinen oberbayerischen Dorf in der Nähe von Eichstätt (Umgeben von rechteckigen Äckern – es war ihm wichtig, dies zu erwähnen) wandelt auf den Spuren von isländischen Musikern wie Múm, Sigur Rós oder Seabear. Wie ein musikalischer Karl May war dieser junge Musiker selber noch nie in Island, im Land seiner Träume. Und doch beherrscht er diese auf der Welt einzigartige musikalische Sprache so perfekt als wäre sie seine eigene (was mittlerweile im Übrigen auch schon die Isländer von FM Belfast gemerkt haben, mit denen er bereits live gespielt hat.)\n\nDer selbe junge Musiker reist durch Afrika, seinen anderen musikalischen Sehnsuchtsort.\nEr saugt die Eindrücke auf wie der berühmte Schwamm. \nDie Rhythmen, die von einem ganz anderen „Pulse“ geprägt sind, als die europäischen. Den Klang für ihn (noch) fremder Instrumente. \nDie Menschen und ihren Zugang zur Musik. \nSchon lange hat er die Minimal-Musiker Steve Reich und Philipp Glass verehrt.\nHat begonnen, sich an der Musikhochschule Münster zum klassischen Schlagwerker ausbilden lassen, eine Arbeit als Musiklehrer in einer Förderschule begonnen und dort hauptsächlich mit Kindern mit Behinderung gearbeitet. Hat neben seiner eigenen Musik auch in einer Band zu spielen begonnen (den inspirierenden Missent To Denmark aus München). Nebenbei hat er auch noch sein Können an der Loop-Station perfektioniert, um all die musikalischen Ideen live alleine umsetzen zu können.\nUnd plötzlich fügen sich die Teile zusammen. Ohne Hammer, ohne Meißel.  \nEs passt einfach: Island, Afrika, Eichstätt, Klassik, Pop, E und U, kalt und warm, bunt und grau, Intuition, professionelles Können und es im richtigen Moment abstreifen können. Kopf, Bauch. Es passt. Es passt, weil Joasihno in der Lage ist, Grenzen zu ignorieren und sie wie selbstverständlich nicht als Hindernis, sondern als Chance zu begreifen.\nEinen ersten Eindruck davon konnten wir alle auf seiner ersten EP „Papiertonnentigertum“ bekommen (erschienen 2009 im Eigenvertrieb).\nDie volle Ladung dieses großen Talents dann Anfang nächsten Jahres:  Joasihnos Debütalbum mit dem Titel „We Say: Oh Well“. \n\n\n\"Einen großen Musikspielplatz hat sich Joasihno in dieser kantigen Papiertonnenwelt geschaffen. Und dahin will er auch den Hörer mitnehmen: in einen musikalischen Rückzugsraum, irgendwo zwischen Expressionismus und Wohlstandsmelancholie. Seine Melodien sind vielschichtig und einfach zugleich, eindringlich und nah. Zwischen Emotion und Struktur bewegen sich seine Songs, da ist er Bands wie Múm, Lali Puna und Hjaltalín ganz ähnlich.\" (Bayerischer Rundfunk)\n\n\"Seine Performance der Songs der neuen EP \"papierTonnenTigerTum\" beeindruckt nicht nur akustisch, sondern auch visuell durch die Projektion von Dia-Bildern.\" (Sueddeutsche Zeitung)\n\n\"Joasihno ist einer, und der holt das Leben ins Zimmer: Geloopte Geräusche, seltsame Instrumente, eine Gitarre wie eine steigende Hoffnung und Sonnenlicht am Dachfenster. Alles gar nicht so abgehoben, und doch ein kleines Wunder: Ein warmer, erlebter Moment München. Da ruft die Süddeutsche Zeitung schon mal die Avantgarde aus.

Born & raised in Paris, between downtown and suburbs, he grew up surrounded by different cultures that really built him, first as a human being and later as an artist.\n\nHe started composing beats at the age of 20 under the name of Rafiralfiro, after spending a childhood possessed with music, from afro-latin, jazz & classical to modern rock and hip-hop. He soon became obsessed with the idea of mixing traditional, folkloric music with modern electronic patterns, looking for the perfect balance between organic and synthetic, old and new, art music and popular music, the holy and the profane, the darkness and the light, the brain and the feet. His musical technic also became part of his identity, dealing with the smallest musical slices to create unique and original patterns from existing music, extracting a texture, a color, a short piece of melody or rythm. Assembling several musical layers to create new soundscapes, ambients & grooves, he works with passion to transform his computer in a dream machine, not just another beatbox.\n\nHe soon started acting in various music fields, composing scores for movies or documentaries, producing beats for rappers / singers, releasing free albums on the web and displaying unique live performance in France and beyond. Next to his solo, main project, he played in some bands or side projects with different musicians and singers. Obviously, the travel (through both time & space) and culture crossing is at the center of his music, and his vision is global, outshining the obsolete concept of «world music». Between latintronics and oriental bass, not to forgot african or balkanic flavoured electronics, his music has no label and keeps evolving in several directions at the same time.\n\nIn 2011, after some of his side projects came to an end, Rafael decided to take a fresh start and to get rid of his old «aka» Rafiralfiro. So he choosed to use his real name as he signed for an EP with the uprising spanish netlabel Caballito, based in Granada & Berlin. Run by two very active dj / producer / visual artists, Grita & Bigote, this one-year-old label releases the finest, freshest music from the nu-latin / tropical bass scene.\n\n«Curandero EP» gathers the newest latin-oriented tracks from Rafael Aragón, from the wildest sambatronics to the sweetest nu-cumbia. Sweaty dancefloor killers and soulful, enlightened anthems to cheer up and enjoy the beauty of life. With a very special, magic touch inspired by the ancient traditions of shamanism from all around the world. Mystic chimes, ritual drums and witchcraft incantations meet club kicks, filthy basslines and electronic batucada to provide a rich, dancy and psychedelic music for hips and ears !\n\n«Curandero EP» will be available for free download (high quality 320kbps mp3) on october 21th, 2011, on Caballito netlabel [CBLLT013].

It\'s a pack of self taught musicians trying to contribute to the present rock scene with their tunes.\n\nThe formation of the band can be accounted to way back in Jan, 2011 when Irfan (Lead Vocalist) & Nikhil (Drummer) were looking for a guitarist. The latter saw Salil (Lead Guitarist) performing at JSS Noida who too intended to form a band & thus the trio saw some good hope in each other. 25th Jan, 2011 was the day they jammed for the first time & were so amazed & delighted to find strikingly similar sense of music & influences. Their first jam they refer to as \"a call and a promise to take a way forward towards cherishing their common dream of making music\" and the rest as they say is history !!\n\nThe trio named the band as “SIN@10” (‘SIN’ being an acronym formed with their initials & since they used to jam at 10 in the morning, came the numeric 10). The band played & won at several war of bands competitions along with some session bassists. Once they got properly acquainted with the whole scenario of playing live & got hold of other technicalities, they realized that it was the right time to work on the Original Compositions (OC’s), to grow as musicians & also to get acknowledged and recognized as a band.\n\nVery soon the band found their full-time bassist in Manish, lending an ecstatic groove to their sound. Being heavily influenced by Pakistani band “Call”, they needed a growler to enhance the Urdu Metal compositions & that’s when Karthik, a hardcore metal-head & a friend of Irfan was invited to join. His growls added a complete new flavor & dimension to the band & also allowed them to diversify their genre & to experiment.\n\nBoth Salil & Irfan had been writing & composing songs all this time & now it was time to recollect the work done. They introduced the OC\'s to other members of the band and by the end of an all-night jam, they could clearly end up with 7 tracks (5 in Urdu/hindi and 2 in English). The compositions came up way better than they\'d expected & gave the band a sound-footing to go for something bigger : An EP !!\n\nNow there grew a need for a more meaningful & relevant name for the band. And thus the name was changed to \'Firaaq\' which means a keen desire for something. The people at ‘Firaaq’ justify the name as: \"we guys came together to fulfill our intense desire to create some good & mesmerizing music & also to make our listeners yearn for more. Through our music we hope to induce desires into people who are crushed & oppressed so they look ahead for a better tomorrow. In a nutshell, we & our listeners, we both are in each others’ ‘Firaaq’ & hence there couldn\'t have been a more apt name but ‘Firaaq’ \" !!!!\n\nThe Band\'s influences range from bands like Call, Akash - The Band, Greenday, Junoon, Entity Paradigm (EP), Jal, Led Zeppelin, RATM, Nirvana, Pink Floyd & Guns n Roses.\n\nThe band is currently working on their first single \'Naya Aashiyaan\' & their EP of six tracks, looking forward to release their music very soon.','thebandfiraaq@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/FiraaqTheBand','','','','167017316722608','612',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','firaaq-the-band'),(806,0,0,0,'Heavens Down','','studioesp@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/Heavensdown','','','','185164781510548','611',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','heavens-down'),(807,0,0,0,'Nepal ka Sangit chor haru.','','','http://www.facebook.com/nepali.copycats','','','','306121182732833','611',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','nepal-ka-sangit-chor-haru'),(808,0,0,0,'Third Culture Sound','Third Culture is an exclusive school for global music education and is the first of it\'s kind in India.\nThird Culture Sound is an institution that is driven by the motto \"Globalization\".At Third Culture, importance is given to technique and skill, while laying equal emphasis on overall performance.We at Third Culture believe in taking indian music to the next level in educating and creating an awareness for the potential that Indian musician\'s possess.The method of teaching is strictly one-on-one, allowing the faculty to understand the student\'s needs individually.The various level of talent and skill present in India which is the second largest population in the world, is beyond belief.

His diverse international sound is influenced from his strong musical background as well as traveling across the world. The dedication and commitment to dance music led him to be one of co-founders, along with Tanseer, of \'The SF Show\', which is India’s FIRST 2 hour international progressive podcast. The show has featured guests like Cid Inc, Darin Epsilon, Sonic Union, Deepfunk etc and recently celebrated its landmark 25th episode. As a part of The SF Show’s launch tour in India, Praveen has played at a few of India’s most sought after clubs.\r\n\r\nHis DJing skills have always gained him a lot of appreciation, but the compliments don’t stop here. His panache & signature style, with an emphasis on a unique combination of “Deep, Tech and Progressive house”, give his audiences the platform they crave. In late 2009, he signed his debut original single \'Crossover\' on \'Maktub Music\', owned by Arjun Vagale & Nicolas Silvano, a monster big-room tune with a star cast of great remixes on board that received play among A-list DJs & producers.\r\n\r\nWith new originals already signed to \'Maktub Music\' and \'Mirabilis Records\', along with remixes on \'Outside The Box Music\' & \'Spherax Records\', 2011 is proving to be Praveen’s favourite year so far! His productions have already received massive support from Sasha, Nick Warren, Cid Inc, Henry Saiz, Darin Epsilon and the likes. Praveen’s guest mixes over various radio shows have been a super hit with his audiences. He has been invited by friskyRadio to showcase an exclusive hour long guest mix on \'Frisky Loves India\' with the other Indian giant artists like Anil Chawla, Arjun Vagale, Sanjay Dutta etc. After many compliments on this guest mix, Praveen was again invited to be featured as \'Artist of The Month\' on friskyRadio. \r\n\r\nAlready on the fast track, Praveen Achary is most definitely a name to keep an eye on.

Born in 1986 to parents who had been traveling for many years, he grew up living in Goa, India six months a year and experiencing its magic and freaky context from an early age.\n\nHis first party in 1999 brought a full understanding of the Goa reality with its emphasis on freedom, and manifested his attraction to trance music. He started collecting music and playing it, at first with a Minidisc player and later with CDJs.\n\nIn 2002, Govinda played his first dj set in the well-known Ninebar in Goa, thus marking the beginning of his dj career. He instantaneously loved the feeling of enjoyment he could provide through music and the palpable interconnection that forms on a dancefloor. After a practice season, he was soon playing in the main party spots in Goa: Discovalley, Paradiso, Primrose, Monkey Valley, Hilltop and many more.\n\nIn 2005, he was signed to Spun records (the GMS label). Two years later, he went on his first international tour where he played along artists such as GMS, Pixel, Alien Project, Spacecat, Domestic, Perplex and Psysex, in Thailand, Nepal, Goa as well as several European countries.\n\nDuring the Goa season of 2007/2008, Govinda started following a different vibe and looking for a more psychedelic sound that would best fit his personality. At the time, Phatmatix, Digital Talk and Concept were his favorite artists. At the Mountain Madness Festival in Nepal, he played a set right before Ajja and fell in love with his sound. The meeting also started a connection with Peak Records, which later led to Govinda being signed on as a label dj.\n\nWhile frequently performing at Goan hotspots such as Club Westend, Hilltop, Ninebar and Shivavalley, he created with a group of friends the NightRainbow Project, a Goa-based party organization responsible for more than ten parties in the first season of its existence. \n\nTo this day, Govinda splits his life between Europe and India and organizes a number of events in both Goa and Italy. He has played at numerous international events (Sonica, Full Moon and Antaris to name but a few) and continues to rock the dancefloors around the globe. His dj sets are widely appreciated for their colorful, positive and twisted sounds, artfully blended to form a harmonic sequence. \n\nLet the adventure begin!This are the biggest parties till 2011:\n\nGoa season 2008/2009:\n29-30.11.08		MYSTICALL Club Westend\n13-14.12.08		REBEL REUNION Club Westend (special dj set by Giuseppe vs Arjuna) \n21-22.12.08		LIQUID SOUNDS Club Westend\n27-28.12.08		TRANSMISSION Club Westend\n31.12.08-02.01.09	THE NEW YEAR PARTY 48hrs Club Westend\n12.01.09			RELOAD Club Westend (special guest Gms Pixel n Manifold)\n12.02.09			COCO HUTS beach party (sp. guest Pixel & Liquid Ross)\n22-23.02.09		SHIVA RATRI Club Westend (special guest Madmaxx, Sirius isness and Gidra)\n29.03.09			ELEMENTS Club Westend (line up by Arjuna)\n30.03.09			RELEASE CHANDRA PARTY\n\nGoa season 2009/2010:\n08.11.09			ARE YOU IN GOA?

The band was formed in 2009 by Ankit Murarka, Sahil Gupta, Kanishk Mehta and Anshul Vashist. It featured Kanishk on vocals, and Ankit on vocals as well as guitars with Sahil, while Deepak Garg was on drums and Anshul on bass and the keyboard. \n\nWinters of 2009 brought about some changes in the lineup with Deepak leaving the band in search of musical enlightenment and the addition of Abhay sharma on Drums. Around about this period in time Kanishk took the reins of lead guitarist and hence shared the same with Ankit. Chokfite, then, proceeded to record a single with Saffire Studios (their original composition ‘someone better than me’), which is now available on its reverbnation and facebook page along with other demo records. \nOctober 2010 brought about another paradigm shift in the band’s existence. Abhay Sharma left the band and Deepak rejoined, hence becoming an integral part on the lineup that stands today; Ankit on vocals and guitars, Sahil on guitars, Kanishk on vocals and guitars, Anshul on synth and bass and Deepak on drums.\nIn Febuary 2011, Chokfite played to a crowd of approximately 1,500 at PSIT, New Delhi. The band also performed at ‘Rocknova’ at Hindustan Times Youth Nexus (held in DCAC, delhi university, south campus) amongst the 10 best bands of the state.\n\nChokfite’s music  is much debated upon due to its non-conformity to a particular genre. Chokfite is arguably the pioneer of ‘Chalk rock’. A five piece band with members from different backgrounds, the influences are many, varying from Alternative to progressive rock and even psychedelic rock. Chokfite\'s music is characterized by ‘let go’ vocals and fills, punk/grunge and rock& roll influenced rhythm guitars with Blues influenced lead guitar, haunting synth effects and drum beats that ‘make a statement’, all complemented by a combination of mature, poetic & contradictory ‘i-don’t-wanna-grow-up’ song writing. The band also tries to bring in a flavour of Psychedelic/Experimental Rock with prolonged keyboard, guitar and drum solos which forms as essential part of their music. \nChokfite is a socially active band and through their music they express what everyone feels and learns through those feelings in every sphere of an exceedingly complicated life. Experience rises over \'on-paper\' biased perceptions. In a world of groggy imperfections, It isn’t in our identity but through our actions that we are defined.  “This is what Chokfite represents and tries to bring to life in the form of music. We want you to take with us a journey of new thoughts; introspection;  meditation; bring your sub-conscious to travel to the conscious, living a life that you want to, into a space of free self.” \n\nPast Gigs:\n\nBlues cafe (3 times)\nThe stage Manajsa\nCafe oz (2 Times)\nTurquoise Cottage\nCafe bahi\nTryst Music Cafe\nUndrgrnd Cafe\nIIM Lucknow Manfest as Headliners\n\nMajor Achievements:\n\n1.

She became taken with artists like Elvis Costello and The Replacements, whose rowdy intellect fit in nicely with the Southern indie-rock she\'d already been exposed to – bands like R.E.M., Pylon and The Rock*A*Teens. When it came time to leave the South, Beth got a job, moved to Brooklyn, got laid off, went to bars and stayed up late with her musician friends – drinking beer and singing songs. But she was also writing songs of her own – songs that felt both brainy and tough, thoughtful and tossed-off, vicious and vulnerable. For so long, Beth had been the consummate green-room insider, but dubious creative outsider – comfortable hanging backstage, but terrified of being on it. For that reason, she wrote for years before sharing so much as a note. But she kept writing, and the number of songs grew. Then finally, a few years down the road – armed with a collection of home-recorded demos – she mustered the courage to send them to friends, and they encouraged her to make an album.\n  \n  \"Defender\" recalls the classic and college rock Beth grew up with, as well as the swagger of old New York girl groups and the insight and sarcasm the early new wave songwriters. Inherent in Beth’s voice is a cool stoicism – a dry, knowing wink that is as affecting in Defender’s moments of dark humor and ornate storytelling as it is in its flashes of unvarnished heartbreak. Beth\'s dry delivery finds a perfect match in lead guitarist Clinton Newman, whose lush, multilayered harmonies and intertwining guitar parts give this record its distinctive sound – something like Chrissie Hynde fronting Squeeze or Nico signed to Stiff Records. As intricate pop songcraft crumbles into gauzy atmospherics and literate observations devolve into boozy chaos, Bird of Youth’s rave ups and kiss offs turn indie-rock braininess back on itself with a casual frivolity. \n\nOver the past few years, Beth has put that wonderfully unstable marriage to the test on stage, appearing with The Wrens, The Mendoza Line, Okkervil River, Roky Erickson, A.C. Newman and others. With the band\'s permanent touring lineup rounded out by bassist Johnny North, drummer Ray Ketchem and keyboardist Eli Thomas, Bird of Youth plan to spend the summer months of 2011 bringing \"Defender\" direct to the fans.      \n\n[press] \nChris Vinyard: vinyard@bighassle.com\n    \n','chris vinyard / vinyard@bighassle.com','http://www.facebook.com/birdofyouth','','','','81141069058','542',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','bird-of-youth'),(853,0,0,0,'Devoid of Dreams','','Kaushik Jai Barua | +91-9650699951','http://www.facebook.com/DevoidOfDreams','','','','167107199981199','541',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','devoid-of-dreams'),(854,0,0,0,'Lalon Band Bangla','','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Lalon-Band-Bangla/187406281300159','','','','187406281300159','540',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','lalon-band-bangla'),(855,0,2,2,'SHKABANG!','Shkabang is a bunch of musicians who have played stage many times, separately.

Thus the vocalist was secluded and what he wanted to do was not happening but the zeal was still alive which needed to be rekindled. As days were passing, the passion for music was making him numb but luckily he met Probin one of his school mate who was then playing guitar. His inviting me to his house resulted in forming some self compositions which till now had ignited the flame within to form another band. Then came Utpal another school friend who also wanted to give his best towards the new Initiative. Indeed,both Utpal and Probin penned down a wonderful song \"Ankhon Mein Ban Gayi\" which is still afresh in our mind. Utpal\'s journey couldn\'t last long as he had other priorities in life. The hunt for a drummer was on when one fine day Probin landed with a so called Drummerist at my house introducing him as Prabh Nair another junior fellow of our school who pressed that he would certainly meet our expectation. Though an amature then, he was given a chance to join us but the problem was he didn\'t have a drum set. That too was taken care off when the newly bought Indian drumkit was stationed at the vocalist\'s house and jamming started. By chance I met Premanjan Bhattacharya another school pal who was a guitarist then,while going to office. The next thing was that I asked him to come the next sunday as some of us had already started jamming. One fine sunday after jamming, Probin told me that he met a fellow named Rajiv who is a guitarist, “Theoretically Sound” and we should once try his capability. Jamming together was going good but we still were missing something i.e a Bass Guitarist. During these incidences my classmate Iqbal hussain started attending the practise sessions and showed his inclination towards playing the Bass Guitar, which finally got fulfilled as we persuaded him to buy one. During that time, the band was going through financial crisis as we didn’t have proper equipments for which some of the band members contributed for buying some equipments.\n\n                   Now the thought of naming the entire Initiative was of prime concern, and it came from the mind of Iqbal Hussain. Thus the band was christined with the name 7Tones. The name means the unity among all the band members as all the notes of music are incomplete without each of them. If talked in hindi it can also be called \"SAATH SUR\". As the band was newly formed, we didn’t have any knowledge what genre to concentrate upon but then we thought of keeping “Hindi Rock” as the topic to play.\n\n    August was round the corner and our jamming sessions were in it\'s peak on the rented attic whose expences we all agreed to share. Practising on the roof was going good and our confidence level reached new heights when a promotional photo shoot was done by one of Iqbal\'s friend. Now the band consists of S.Kamal,Probin,Prabh Nair,Premanjan,Rajiv and Iqbal hussain. With this line up we video recorded two covers and one self composition but still the crave for getting shows was eating us within. Time flew by and the festive season was near and luckily we bagged a couple of shows in Durga Puja in Sep 2009.We started on a good note and plastered our confidence level by also performing in Christmas Carnival followed by performance in New Year’s Eve on 31st Dec 2009 in Indore. However, the new year didn’t start with a happy note as differences cropped up among the band members and the productivity of the band decreased. Premanjan left the band due to his personal problems and Rajiv was asked to leave as it was a joint decision taken by all of us. So now we were 4 members left in the band and the hunt for a lead guitarist was revived again.\n\n                      Through Orkut, we came in contact with Abhishek Bhandari a college going lad who just started strumming the guitar then. He was being called by us and his potential was knocked. Though an amature, his mingling nature was liked by all of us and he started attending our jam sessions. In july 2010 we got a chance to perform in a charity show for an N.G.O where the band members regained their confidence and started everything altogether. But something else was written in the destiny of 7Tones.Probin started keeping himself more involved in his father’s business due to which his interest was becoming less towards the band. At the end Probin parted from us after giving his best in Durga Puja 2010 and finally four of us were there to take the journey of 7Tones ahead.\n\n----------  A New Era Started ---------\n\nNow it was a mammoth task ahead how we should had continued the journey as already many members chose their different ways. We strategically planned, worked upon weeks and decided what should be our next step and how often we should jam. After few months everybody started jamming at kamal’s house where practicing upon our Self Compositions and taking input’s from each other was our prime concern. During this time kamal’s neighbour invited trouble for us by calling the police. It was an harrowing experience then but we managed somehow. Our jamming still continued with full vigor and we were lucky enough to bag a show on the New Year’s eve of 2010 in Meerut. It was one of the highest paid shows. We never looked back after that and kept on performing in various battle of bands and even won many accolades. It’s been almost 9 to 10 months of our continuous efforts for which we are getting the fruitful results. \n   \n     We are moving ahead keeping in mind the genres like Rock / Sufi / Fusion and it could very well be heard in our own Self Compositions.Soon we would be coming with our first single “Pari” of our yet to be released album.\n\n7TONES family :-\nPremanjan Bhattacharya, Probin, Rajiv, Vishal.','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/7Tones/114741451910863','','','','114741451910863','535',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','7tones'),(858,0,0,0,'Ibn Batuta & Tatar','The concept was formed in the year 2000. iBt is the winner of Band E Mataram III.

In 2006, Shyam and Varun left the band being busy with their studies. The band came into a short hiatus, losing the two members and lack of a permenant jam room. \n\nA few months later, the silence was finally over in early 2007, when Vivek and Arun met Divin, a guitarist who was looking for fellow musicians to form a metal band. Divin joined on guitars and soon a friend of the group, Rixon joined on bass and started jamming at the \'old house\' jamroom behind Divin\'s house.\n\nRixon and Arun left after a few months, and the slots were filled soon by Dino, brother of Divin on drums and David on bass. With the new line up, the band decided on sounding more heavier and started working on original sound. A few killer gigs in different cities in Kerala gathered them an underground cult following of their music. Divin left the band in 2008 with a promise of joining back again. Guitarist Bineesh joined on guitar duties.\n\nWarhorse Chained, widely known in short as WHC, is reckoned as the pioneers of extreme metal in Kerala togather with Darkcrucifix.

Upon its birth, the band was named “AZAZEL” by the members. Although, the first few months of this band were frustrating, they continued jamming some songs by Black Sabbath and Old Sepultura. Barzak, at its preliminary stage faced lineup inefficiency. The band found a palpable lineup in the early 2004 (around January). \n\nInitially, the band tried some experimental single releases, blending 80’s heavy metal and thrash/death metal elements. They recorded their 1st demo single in April 2004 titled “Judhou Shanti Chaay”. The second single was titled as “Imaan” which is when the band found a new name “BARZAKH”. The song “Malakul-Maut”, dedicated to the Angel of Death was the last single the band released in that year. At that time Barzakh was: Naushad (Saad)-Guitars, Amit-Vocals/ Guitars/ Bass, Rana-Drums. For axeman Naushad (Saad) quitting the band became necessary, and he left the country for higher studies. This was a wearisome era for the remaining members. Subsequently, Barzakh went to a long hibernation, almost to a state of non-existence. For about ten months the band had no activities. \n\nThe revivification of the band took place in the middle of the year 2005, when the vocal & guitarist Amit and the battery Rana took initiatives to hire a permanent bassman and reform the band. That’s when Rony joined. At this time (around July) they started working on some new tracks. After two and a half months of continuous rehearsals they released the debut Demo tape titled “Opocheshta” in September under the new and ultimate name “BARZAK” which was recorded at BD Sounds, Dhaka during a rehearsal session. This was a self release and was limited to only 17 copies. The demo consisted of four rehearsal and raw versions of songs. \n\nBarzak released their debut Album (full-length) titled “Qabiluhu” in 12th August 2006, consisting 9 tracks including the unreleased demo tape “Narabali”. That was recorded in 2005-2006 at Sound Machine Studio and Art of Noise Studio, Dhaka Bangladesh. This album was re-released by Sacramental Records, Brazil on 5th February 2007, limited to 100 copies which were distributed via Nihilistic Music: Distribution and Production, Brazil. \n\nUp until now all the songs are released in their native language Bengali, but, in future the band plans to release every song in English. \n\nAt present, Barzak is a trio and wills to be it as long as the Mighty Hell can bear. Barzak only focuses on preaching hatred through its own compositions as a prelude to the upcoming dissolution of the illusory earth. The dramatic intoxication of the tempter demiurge is forever bestowed upon feeble minded humans. Dancing upon the carcasses of ignorant hyles, Barzak ties itself with the ever devouring forces of death & destruction for the manifestation of impure hatred and spiritual detachments from the hyles. \nTherefore, Barzak hails the esoteric spiritualism of the reverse current and the burning path of self-becoming!! \n','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/BARZAK/131693500413','','','','131693500413','487',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','barzak'),(894,0,0,0,'T For Two','','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/T-For-Two/122920907763169','','','','122920907763169','486',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','t-for-two'),(895,0,0,0,'Adroit','\'\'ADROIT\'\' - Means \'\'Skilful\'\'...........\\m/...\\m/...\\m/ The Band was formed in 2000 with Dondor-Guitar,Remdor-Vocals,Wallam-Bass n Benny-Drums n the Band started playing covers like-Halloween,Mr.Big,Rainbow,Fire House,White Lion,Deep Purple,Great White,Y N T,Skid Row,Riot,Mass,Roxus,Guns N Roses...etc in n around Hynniewtrep places,on 2004 the Band two members(Benny n Remdor)split then Tony n Eamond-(Who is the vocalist of the popular gospel Band Atiar)came in where Eamond on Vocals n Tony on Drums,n these two also didnt last long,where as on 2005 two members split again n then new members were in again as Mangara on Drums n Hubert on Vocals and after a very2 hard work n practises,The Band has achieved as the Runners up in the beat contest in Sain Kardev College,then became the Winner of The Flames Of Rock Beat Contest n Continue with the Winner of \'\'The Hero Honda Campus Rock Idols\'\' in the Regional Final in shg 2006-07 n after all these success the Band Released a Debut Album \'\'The Adroit\'\' on 2007,n on 2008 Hubert split the Band,then Domanic who is the X- member of some popular Band in Shillong Like Un-fade,Innocent Eyes...etc,Joined the Band n on 2010 the Band also Achieved to be the Winner of the Shillong Lajong(SLFC) Theme Song Compitetion\\Theme Song Composition...n the Band now is still busy working in originals for the Up cumin 2nd Album......n ADROIT Would Like To Give Thanks to all the people N Fanz who supported us n also to all the Hynniewtrep people for ur love n support....\\m/','SHILLONG - 9863268714','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Adroit/146740928704447','','','','146740928704447','484',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','adroit'),(896,2,1,1,'The Jass B\'stards','The band would like to make it known to all that:\r\n\r\n1: They do not play jazz\r\n2: They are not bastards\r\n2: They are proud of not having attended Berklee School of Music\r\n3: They play for neither Emperor Minge nor The Ska Vengers, even if it looks like they do\r\n4: They stubbornly refuse to write a biography on their facebook info page lest it be lifted wholesale to form the basis of an article and/or listings write ups by grammatically challenged and cliche spouting junior hacks.','+91 (0)99112 90113','http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Jass-Bstards/133945863304355?','','','','0','482',0,NULL,1,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-10-09 13:30:08',155,'[\"stiffkittensinc@gmail.com\"]','[\"+91 (0)99112 90113\"]','the-jass-bstards'),(897,0,0,0,'ViceVersa','Bangalore-based music producer Manas Ullas and Mumbai-based musician P-Man aka Rohit Pereira came together to embark on their musical venture ViceVersa.

Since that’s easier said than done… we’re gonna start by saying it! Our loves span Asia to Zappa, and much in between. But when it comes to shove, we push the music we love most – hard guitar driven music, with melodic vocals and progressive overtones.\n\nThanks for stopping by!

The band is the brainchild of two musicians, Demodulated and Astaroth. They were friends and shared same musical interests and thinkings. To express themselves, the two formed the band and were joined by Morax on Guitar, Xezbeth on Bass, Ohee on Drums while Astaroth were also on Guitars and Demodulated handled Vocals.\n\nSoon after the formation, the band started rehearsaling together and the musical direction was clear. The band drew inspiration from infamous Dissection, Necrophobic and other sinister acts such as Watain, Thulcandra, Black Horizons and likes. Their black\\ death approach on music was enriched with dark, occult lyrics and furious performances and mastery of musical skills.\n\nIt was then when they were serious about their own material and started working on it. They were composing their  own songs but parted by their drummer, Ohee. The replacement of him was found in Malphas, who joined in soon.\n\nThey signed a record contract with local record label “Dust and Guilt Records” and entered into studio in December, 2011. The songs were recoded and released as “Light Devours Our Lust” EP on January 26, 2012. The songs from the release showed the death tinged black metal tendencies from their cited influences. The EP contains seven tracks, including an Intro and an Outro, all displaying morbid and occult words spit out in darker, evil, extreme way.\n\nABOMINABLE CARNIVORE’s current line-up consists of Demodulated (Vocals), Astaroth (Guitars), Morax (Guitars) and Malphas (Drums).','abominablecarnivore@hotmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/abominablecarnivore','','','','132134876878140','448',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','abominable-carnivore'),(917,0,0,0,'\"Trigger The Massacre\"','Its a newly formed band from Chandigarh.The mates are from different regions of India who met at a college campus.Pankaj from Himachal Pradesh, Siddharth and Arjun from Delhi, Nitish from Chandigarh and Abhishek from Jammu(j&k)...now the band is ready with their 2 originals with one single named \"An Enemy Behind The Line\" already released.','08054463100,09780830844,08054547078','http://www.facebook.com/Triggerthemassacre','','','','183080635071568','448',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','trigger-the-massacre'),(918,0,0,0,'Pangea','Pangea is a Prog Metal/Soundtrack/Drone outfit from Mumbai.

At this point, it was clear that an album was in the works, and stirred up by the criticism of skeptics, VICE wryly named the album \"Career Suicide.\"\n\nSince then VICE has been no stranger to the stage. He has performed at some of the Northeast\'s most reputable venues, such as The Middle East Downstairs, Harper\'s Ferry, and The Bowery Poetry Club. VICE even had the opportunity to perform inside the general assembly hall at The United Nations in 2007 for their International Day Of Peace celebrations. VICE has had the opportunity, either in the studio or on stage, to work with some of Hip Hop\'s greatest legends including Kool G Rap, Edo. G, Immortal Technique, Freeway, Styles P, M.O.P. and more.\n\nWith multiple albums under his belt, tracks off his latest LP, \"James And The Giant Beats\" featuring hip hop legends Kool G Rap, Edo. G and Killa Sha burning up radio across the country and internationally, and his recent selection as one of URB Magazine\'s Next 100 Artists, VICE can only foresee himself as a powerful voice for a generation who may rather remain silent.','info@arclassicrecords.com','http://www.facebook.com/viceversahmusic','','','','73601981960','419',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','viceversah'),(942,0,0,0,'Orantem','Orantem is an epic tale of emotions. It will take you on a journey through your own mind and at the end you will be craving for more. A definitive piece in the history of Music.\n\nOrantem is a band extremely passionate about the music it creates. Orantem was originally created when the founding members, Aviral Bajpai (Vocalist,Guitarist) got along with Prachi Gupta (Vocalist) and decided they had to make a band after the success of their duet on Aviral\'s album \"A Step Into The Horizon\". They started making music for the band that suited the requirements for the genre of Gothic Metal. In 2011, Abhishek Sharma joined the band and shouldered the responsibility of being the guitarist and the trio was then ably joined by Karan on the drums and Vibhu who shouldered the bass and percussions.\n\nOn the 14th February 2011, Orantem  released the single \"I\'m With You\" by Republic Digital Distribution. It will be available on all major online music stores including iTunes, Amazon, Napster, emusic, shockhound, thumbplay etc.\n\nTheir music is a portrayal of their deep love for the music they make and has helped them gather a lot of  fans.

Sorry, music. The brainchild of Vikram, Rohan and Tomojit, Grey Shack was formed sometime in mid-July 2007, after which they went on to play gigs (read competitions) in and around the wonderfully wonderful city of Chennai. Underground 2007 hosted by The Unwind Centre provided Grey Shack with a launchpad to showcase their music, and the band ended up winning the competition, making their presence felt in the Chennai circuit very early on. More competitions followed, and only recently have Grey Shack started playing gigs. Their music is an eclectic mix of Rock N\' Roll, Grunge, Funk and Blues, thus, the non-conformity to stick to a particular genre. The members draw their influences from numerous acts, which only adds to versatility of Grey Shack\'s music. So sit back, pop a beer (or anything more suited to your well-being) and listen up. \r\n\r\nMembers:\r\nRohan Sen (Vox) - Rohan has been brought up on a diet of Elvis, The Beatles, The Who and other such acts from the glorious 60s and 70s. Ever seen Winnie The Pooh getting it on with a mic stand?\r\n\r\nVikram Vivekanand (Guitars) - An 80s fanatic, he draws inspiration from the testosterone-driven quirky haired guitarists from the age. His influences include John Petrucci, Frank Gambale, Steve Morse and Joe Satriani. Lately, he\'s taken a liking to Bangalore\'s TAAQ as well. Vikram also doubles up as the official band driver. It\'s his car.\r\n\r\nVinay Ramakrishnan (Drums) - Drawing influences from Mike Portnoy, Carter Beauford, Aaron Spears and even having learnt from Benny Greb for a short period, Vinay is one of the hardest rocking drummers that you can find in Madras. He can really lay down a groove! He also doesn\'t have a drum kit. Yep...he sold it, and then he started getting more gigs. \r\n\r\nMadhav Ravindranath (Bass) - Maybe the odd one out, because he likes a lot of metal. But we still love him and he can really rock! And that\'s why he\'s our bassist. This biker, engineer and record label owner was also seen dancing to desi music at a popular club in Madras.\r\n\r\nPrevious Members:\r\n\r\nTomojit Basu (Bass) - Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Beatles, Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, Incubus, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Rage Against The Machine are all acts he thrives off. His nose is worth a million, soon to be seen in a beauty magazine near you!\r\n\r\nDeepak (Drums) - He died. Kidding. Deepak\'s invaluable contribution to Grey Shack\'s sound is recognized by all who know the band. Grey Shack misses the TASMAC man and wishes him all the best for future projects. Whoever said academics help, lied.\r\n\r\nElvin D\'Costa Jones Fernandez John Smith (Drums) - Yes, his name really is that long. A Jazz drummer, Elvin enjoys doses of Steely Dan, Dennis Chambers and so on. Incidentally, Elvin is a male feminist.

It\'s like that old school Detroit rock where everybody got jazz, blues, and R&B tutelage and then went and joined garage bands (thus fostering the punk and metal yet to come).

Progressive music being his main weapon of choice. He has very flexible progressive style ranging from a very intelligent techy style to a nice lush progresssive sound and more in between. Recently he has gotten on board with Glitchy Tonic Records (Germany) and is looking forward to promote his more darker techy sound with them, and also to promote the other brilliant artists on the label. \r\n\r\n2010 was the year in when he released a whoe lot of music on Glitchy.Tonic.Records and Fatali Music this included a full length album, an EP and a few tracks on various compilations. 2010 also saw him remix Fatali\'s Dreaming track which was then selected and released on Fatali\'s Label – Fatali Music and then was given an oppurtunity to release an original EP on Fatali Music, which reached the Beatport Psytrance top Downloaded Charts.

Wanting to complete the band and move past the whole covers rut that bands get stuck in, after much searching, almost in the same week they came across keyboard player, Anis Gandhi(of Sledgehammer fame) who bass player Sonam Lama. The 5 instantly clicked and got together for their first show at Cafe Goa for BEP\'s UTV music and movies night opening for the band Aftertaste.\nWith various influences of Funk, Metal, Progressive Metal, Western Classical, Grunge , Classic and pop-rock, Sonam and Akshay did most of the songwriting with the entire band actually coming together to complete and arrange songs.\n\nThe music that the 5 churn out is an interpretation by 4 people of a song written by the fifth.\n\nWhile they are constantly working on their increasing originals set, the band are at present in the process of recording a 5 song EP to get some of their music out and not just leave it online.

Akshay Deodhar on vocals and rhythm guitar is the songwriting talent, crafting the incendiary musicianship of Anis Gandhi on piano, Zain Calcuttawala on percussion and drums, Clavell Santiago on violin and Sonam Lama on bass into scattered sound-packets stitched in melodies and harmonies. Grunge based, heavy, reverberating sounds echo in a spiral of constant whirlpool of musical emoting – Spook represent everything a young band should be. Passionate. That’s the least you can expect out of an outfit represented by a gawking Owl called Pedro as the mascot, considering their influences range from Pearl jam, Chris Cornell, Coldplay, RHCP, GooGoo Dolls, Alice In Chains, Foo Fighters, The Calling and Kings of Leon to name a few. Progressively new age, yet rebelliously old-skool; Spook songs bridge the gaps between instrumental solos and melodic riffs enchantingly. Diverse logic may be easy to define each band mate’s musical heritage Post their one gig at Café Goa where they played a 3 song solo set, where a call for resurrection from a threatening damper called power failure only displayed their eclectic performance skills.

During the tour, we not only had a good excuse to holiday with our kids but we had the opportunity to meet people who really inspired and encouraged us to continue socio-political activities here in Nepal , with punk/hardcore as a vehicle, and giving respect to D.I.Y. ethics. \nChris Luppi (Arise zine and Elephant Eye Records) in Thailand was also extremely encouraging as we fumbled through the beginnings. \nRai Ko Ris then toured Malaysia in March 2002. The incredible experience of meeting and learning from fellow Asian punks added more fuel to our fire. The collectives and individuals we met allowed us to rock ourselves to a heatstroke in the name of active punk.\n\nWe visited Sri Lanka & South India (travelled by road/train) at the end of last year. Played our acoustic set to some mafia who owned bars and kept guns in their kitchen – and who recorded us on their mobile phones! \nWe didn\'t find any d.i.y. hc/punk scenes in either Sri Lanka or South India , but there was a mass of metal/rock genres, pretty high-fi events, & not much on the socio-political front (even though we were not just looking for that). We couldn\'t afford the live gigs advertised on posters! The fun of watching Angus Young on a big screen at a metal bar in Bangalore & students headbanging along wore off as fast as our cash did. \nA lot like Nepal , the most pro-active people we met were local musicians who live in villages and came begging to the city centres, or human rights activists.

Jonas truly realized his musical passion when he picked up a guitar for the first time in 2002. He quickly mastered the guitar and started fine-tuning and shaping his voice to the characteristic yet versatile style of singing that we enjoy today. The first single ‘Get Me Out’ from the album ‘A Weight Off My Mind’ was written in Sweden during 2006. \nJonas’ ‘Get Me Out’ came true in 2007 when he was approached by producer Reiner Erlings and signed by Involved Music, Dubai. Jonas moved to Dubai to pursue his professional music career.\n\nDesai opened for Jesse Cook, David Gray and Robin Gibb at the Dubai International Jazz Festival in Feb 2008 shortly after releasing his first EP \'Get me out\' through Involved Music. After spending the rest of the year in the studio, Jonas\' debut album ‘A Weight Off My Mind’ was successfully launched in the Middle East at the end of December 2008. In reviews of ‘A Weight Off My Mind’ Jonas has been compared to a young John Mayer.\n2009 started at a high pace where some of the highlights were the headline spots at Dubai Tennis Championship Official Player’s party and ‘The Slobfest’ in Dubai as well as the visit to his fans in India with a gig at the renowned Blue Frog, Mumbai.

Northeast India has been a home to major rock musicians and hosts the biggest rock competition called The Hornbill National Rock, with over $10,000 of prize money. It has been previously won by Joint Family, Hobos. Other bands from this region include those from Mizoram, Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Darjeeling and Manipur.Notable bands from Manipur are Phoenix/ Phynyx won the North-East Beat Contest in 1990, IIT-Mumbai Mood Indigo rock competition (no mean feat, Mood-I was the biggest amateur level rock contest), BITS Pilani Rocktaves \'93 etc. In an opinion poll conducted by the readers of the Rock Street Journal magazine they were also one among top 5 bands along side – Bangalore Thrashers Millennium, Delhi’s Parikrama, Indus Creed and Agni (Pune).\n\nRunway tracks,Humming birds,Blue stars,Family Dog,Magnetos,Hell Angels, Rex\'s,Post-Marks,The Cannibals,The Dark Krusader/The Drixian Empires,The Power-Pak,Red Devils,Illegals,The Recycle,The Dirty Strikes.\n\nThe following musicians/bands have performed live in Shillong:\n\nScorpions (band)\nFireHouse\nPetra\nSepultura\nEric Martin\nWhite Lion\nMr.Big\nAir Supply\nMichael Learns To Rock\n\nIn early February 2010, Swiss Folk Metal Band Eluveitie played live at IIT Guwahati(Assam).\n\nIndependent record labels\n\nMainstream record labels in India often ignore rock, with a few exceptions. Album sales range between a few hundred copies to a few thousand. They are rarely, if at all, affiliated to the Indian music industry, and sales are not usually monitored. Songs of bollywood usually gain more popularity as compared to the songs of bands. This is a huge set back. Bands also fail to sell their songs throughout the country even after making it available to major music stores, this is only due to lack of interest of people in rock bands. There are only a few bands that have become successful in selling their songs throughout the country. People who enjoy rock get the songs of their favorite bands, just by a click form any music website (sometimes their songs are uploaded by website administrators just after the day of release, this is illegal as per copyright law, but even then no action is taken). Hence, overall sales become less than expected. Bands in India mostly perform live shows with low priced tickets (as low as Rs.100 or even less). People in the country have no respect for rock musicians/bands. Probably, the growing and the upcoming generation will have interest in Indian Rock and Metal. But care has to be taken to retain the copyright of the music.\n\nThe future looks encouraging thanks to entities such as Green Ozone, DogmaTone Records, Eastern Fare Music Foundation, that are dedicated to promoting and supporting Indian rock.','','http://www.facebook.com/TheRockBandsOfNortheastIndia','','','','132851476728950','259',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','the-rock-bands-of-northeast-india'),(1082,0,0,0,'Chihan','trying to cut out a decent album.','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Chihan/103053453073541','','','','103053453073541','255',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','chihan'),(1083,0,0,0,'Deep Sound Channel','','deepsoundchannel@hotmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Deep-Sound-Channel/17766214094','','','','17766214094','254',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','deep-sound-channel'),(1084,0,0,0,'Footstep Theory','','chirag@therockfever.com','http://www.facebook.com/footsteptheory','','','','164773523623493','254',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','footstep-theory'),(1085,0,0,0,'Punk On Toast','Punk.On.Toast is a 4 piece mumbai based punk rock band.

After banging away relentlessly for years, he happened to hear Tool’s Lateralus album and decided that he wanted to take it seriously. Despite the lack of a drum kit, he began taking formal lessons from renowned drummer Gino Banks. Not owning a kit did not hinder his progress and infact enhanced his drum programming skills and his knowledge of drum theory as he would program beats and air drum to them. \n\nYears of air drumming finally paid off and he was rewarded with his first drum kit, coincidentally a Mapex, which he eventually came to endorse. His love for Paiste became evident then as, with his limited budget, he chose to buy a pair of Paiste 402 hi-hats instead of buying a Solar Starter Pack. He used just those hats for over 2 years then slowly expanded his kit to its current  setup containing over 20 high end Paiste cymbals.\n\nToday, he is known not only for his ability to adapt to different musical settings but also for his in depth knowledge of drum theory, its advanced applications and technical prowess for flawless execution of the same. \n\nHis major influences are Danny Carey, Gavin Harrison, Tomas Haake, Virgil Donati, Marco Minnemann, Mike Mangini, Thomas Lang, Terry Bozzio , Josh Freese and Tim Alexander. Glimpses of their various styles are visible at times in his primary playing style which can be broadly described as Progressive. He has studied odd time signatures, unconventional patterns and polyrhythms in great detail and subtly incorporates them in his playing. \n\nHis motto has always been “If the drum gods can do it, then with the right mindset, hard work and practice, you can too”. It is this very philosophy that has made him strive harder to achieve his goals. Those who’ve seen him live can vouch to how he makes even the most complex drum parts look easy.\n\nHamza designed and fabricated his own Custom Bell Stand which was inspired by Gavin Harrison’s Sonor Bell Stand. The Bell Stand was also featured on a show on CNN-IBN as part of their “Engineers who are Musicians” Program.\n\nHamza has been the official drum instructor at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, since 2008. He has taught over 250 students there. He has also conducted clinics in many colleges across India in places like Pune, Delhi, Chennai, Rookee, Goa,  Nagpur, New Bombay, Pilani, Lucknow and many more. Hamza’s Clinics are a regular at Music Conferences like the Palm Expo.\n\nThe bands which Hamza has played for are as follows:\n\nEggless Love Cake (Alternative/Grunge)\nLethe (Thrash Metal)\nZohak (Thrash Metal)\nBitchslap (Hardcore)\nApollonian Quest (Technical Death Metal)\nWorkshop (Comedy Metal)\nReverrse Polarity (Scremo)\nCoshish (Progressive Rock)\nAbraxas (Djent)\nAxetortion (Instrumental Rock)\nKvanaa (Hindi Rock)\n\nHe has been a Live Session Drummer for the following artists/bands:\nKhiladi (Comedy Rock)\nPrayag (Hindi Rock)\nApernit Singh (Instrumental Rock)\nZodiac (Alternative)\nClaver Menezes (Instrumental Rock)\nMedusa (Electronica)\nRevival (Power Metal)\nRed Cube (Alternative)\nParesh Kamath (Funk Fusion)\nJaneen Leah (Blues)\nKavita Seth (Sufi Rock)\n','Contact No: 9820589707  Email: hamzakazi@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hamza-Kazi/311048258913719','','','','311048258913719','244',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','hamza-kazi'),(1094,0,0,0,'Space','In the winter of 2008, one evening Tritha along with her friend, Ritika decided to make music very “simply in their living room in Kolkata...\nSince then, Space has performed in many clubs and pubs in Calcutta including Someplace Else, Park and several times at The Big Ben, Kenilworth Hotel.\nIn Delhi at Cafe Morrison, Geoffrey\'s, International Diner, Turquoise Cottage, Cafe Oz and at the Wills Fashion Week 2010-11.\nThe band was also invited in Naukuchiatal for the ESCAPE festival in May 2010 and 2011.\nThey performed in July 23rd in Paris at Les Ecoliers, a musical bar in Paris promoting new and experimental world music bands.','emailsofspace@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/soundofspace','','','','207827039250069','243',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','space'),(1096,0,0,0,'7:10','710 is a rock band from bangalore consisting of amyth adhir aditya and rahul...... the band tries to balance out the melody side of things with some heaviness to it while writing music!! we believe in the 70\'s lifestyle!!! rock n roll 4 life!!!! \n','Swathi Chatrapathy ','http://www.facebook.com/the710','','','','129188653803982','235',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','710'),(1097,0,0,0,'The Syndicate GOA','','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Syndicate-GOA/157069194324044','','','','157069194324044','235',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','the-syndicate-goa'),(1098,0,0,0,'Avyakta','Avyakta means unexpressed.

A typical set list of the band includes songs from artists like The Eagles, Bo Bice, Linkin Park, Ben Harper, Poets of the Fall and Nil Langdrens Funk Unit just to name a few. The band also excels at giving old songs a new twist so that they sound relevant today just as they did back in the day.\n\nThis diverse genre of songs is due to the varied musical inclinations of the band members. Besides making for a unique listening experience, it also challenges the band members to learn different techniques, appreciate different styles and helps them grow as musicians. A lot of time is spent deciding upon the set list as the aim of the band is not only to entertain an audience but also open up new musical portals for the average listener.\n\nApart from doing covers the band has original compositions in the pipeline which it seeks to incorporate into their future playlists. As with the covers they do, the band’s originals are guaranteed to vary in style and feel too. Although they are only a couple of shows old, the band has already begun to carve a niche for themselves in the music circuit.

While his friends studied, and his parents worried, he immersed himself in sounds, creating his own unique brand of electronica. His curiosity and eagerness has not waned ever since.\r\nHe began producing music in 2003 and has done numerous projects since working with artists such as Anoushka Shankar, Chebi Sabah, Karsh Kale, Midival Punditz, to name a few. He\'s also produced music for a few film scores. Despite having no formal training in music theory, Jayant has created exceptional work with all of these artists and continues to work with many more.\r\nBoundaries as an artist are practically limitless for him, and that ethos reflects in all his work. His influences come from a wide spectrum of artists & musicians ranging from Indian classical, electronica, rock, psy-chill, trance, techno and ambient. Jayant has developed a unique style of music by experimenting with all these genres. He works with what moves him emotionally and translates that experience into his own, eclectic electronic sound.\r\nEven though these genres give a fundamental idea of his work, you still cannot characterize what you really experience and feel at his shows. It is indescribable in words alone, you just have to come, listen and see for yourself.\r\nJiiter is a Live/Dj Minimal & Techno act by Jayant. The Sound of Jitter is very edgy, hi-tech and psychedelic in nature, almost bridging the gap between outdoor and club.','jayant@jmusic.in','https://www.facebook.com/Jitterlive','http://www.jmusic.in','','','0','166',0,NULL,1,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-10-09 13:11:38',296,'[\"\"]','[\"\"]','jayant-jitter'),(1140,0,0,0,'AURA','','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/AURA/147257675349605','','','','147257675349605','166',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','aura'),(1141,0,0,0,'PrayaQ','','+91-9993546363','http://www.facebook.com/prayaq','','','','116495265107877','166',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','prayaq'),(1142,0,0,0,'The Yellow Pages','The Yellow Pages was started in 2005 by Gaurav  Jagwani and Simran Talreja with the common interest of exciting audiences all around with a unique acoustic take on modern and classic rock hits.

With members representing some of China’s 56 ethnic groups, including the Wa and Buyi ethnic minorities from Yunnan and Guizhou, the four-piece aims to promote and preserve the colorful and diverse heritage of Yunnan and Guizhou’s many ethnic minority tribes through original compositions and reworkings of local folk melodies.\n\nShanren fuse indigenous music with rock, reggae, and ska, while showcasing a variety of traditional instruments such as the xiangzi and qinqin (four-stringed plucked instruments) and xianggu (a type of drum). Gaining popularity in Beijing’s small but vibrant alternative folk scene on the strength of their energetic live shows, the band appeared in front of 5,000 people in Cathedral Square at the Barcelona Festival Asia 2010. In 2011, Shanren performed at MIDEM in Cannes and Liverpool Sound City, UK. They are staple headliners at China’s major music festivals and have been featured twice on Hunan Television, reaching an audience in the tens of millions. Wild, eccentric, and charismatic, Shanren are true ambassadors for China’s ethnic diversity and emerging musical creativity.\n\n2009 saw the release of their self-titled debut, and the band is currently recording the follow-up, to be released in early 2012.\n\nHIGH RES PHOTO DOWNLOAD: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3333970/shanren/shanren%20photos.rar\n\nPress for Shanren:\nEthinic Music Tests the Limits in China, The New York Times \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/world/asia/17music.html\n\nChinese Indie-Folk Band Shanren Uses Crowdfunding to Connect with Fans for North American Tour, Crowdsourcing.org\nhttp://www.crowdsourcing.org/document/chinese-indie-folk-band-shanren-uses-crowdfunding-to-connect-with-fans-for-north-american-tour-/11090\n\nResponse to Times Piece, World Music Network\nhttp://www.worldmusic.net/news/news/2011-09-21/ethnic-music-tests-limits-in-china/\n\nFolk Explosion, Time Out Beijing (PDF)\nhttp://jenniferconrad.org/folk1.pdf\n\nInterview, Kochipan (in French)\nhttp://kochipan.over-blog.com/article-interview-shanren-73397165.html\n\nInterview, Smart Shanghai\nhttp://www.smartshanghai.com/articles/nightlife/interview-shanren\n\nInterview, Pangbianr\nhttp://pangbianr.com/shan-ren-interview/\n\nLive Review, The Beijinger\nhttp://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2011/12/19/Weekend-Live-Music-Reviews-Hanggai-Shanren\n\n\nLinks:\nRocketHub: http://rockethub.com/projects/5431-shanren-tour-shangri-la-to-north-america\n\nSoundCloud: http://soundcloud.com/shanren\n\n','unitysam@gmail.com','http://www.facebook.com/shanrenband','','','','317592468268482','162',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','shanren'),(1146,0,0,0,'Requiem','','','http://www.facebook.com/Ontologus','','','','126507464093552','162',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','requiem'),(1147,0,0,0,'Grossty','swinery is lavatory','','http://www.facebook.com/Grossty','','','','123217304451132','162',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','grossty'),(1148,0,0,0,'Short Round','My music is a selection of songs played most when busking on the streets of England.

As both a DJ and producer, Dale\'s musical diversity cuts across the deepest and darkest percussive house, to a tougher 4am club sound that borders the line between house and techno. \r\n\r\nA musician through and through, Dale is equally at home manning the controls in the studio as he is in the the dingiest of dimly lit low ceiling basement clubs or the main stage of an outdoor festival.\r\n\r\nAppearances at some of the the most widely respected clubs and parties in the world - Cocoon in Frankfurt, Ministry of Sound in London, the Miami Winter Music Conference etc. - has solidified his reputation as a consistent deliverer of quality.\r\n\r\nA British Canadian born in Vancouver, Dale got an early start at the height of the warehouse scene in the late nineties, playing rave parties in Canada and the US. As things developed, Dale migrated westward across the Atlantic to what was then the epicentre of the house scene, London England. It was here that his career began to take shape, as Dale played dates up and down the country - from Ministry of Sound in London, to Gatecrasher in Birmingham, Honey in Brighton to Digital in Bristol. As Dale\'s productions started to gain support from the international DJ community, his own DJ schedule blossomed. Dale was invited further afield to places like Eastern Europe, Central and South America, Asia, and beyond.\r\n\r\nIt was also in London where Dale met long time friend and production partner Anil Chawla. The duo\'s first ever track, \"Makes Me Feel\", was an instant hit, with Saved Records label boss Nic Fanciulli snapping it up for inclusion on his Renaissance compilation. Other labels took notice, and heavyweight Global Underground came calling, asking the boys to do a full length artist album. \"Roadhouse\" was released on Global Underground to critical acclaim from all the major dance music press, with DJ Mag calling it \"sparkling pro to-prog pop\" to IDJ who said that Dale and Anil had \"set the standard for 2009\".\r\n\r\nThe fourth track on the album \"Leftorium\" went on to be one of GU\'s biggest single releases ever, sitting in the top ten on the main Beatport chart for more than two months, and garnering a nomination for Best Deep House track in the Beatport Awards. Following on from this, Dale and Anil released the first ever GU Loopmasters Sample Pack, mixed the GU Classics compilation on GU Music, and joined the GU artist roster as resident DJs.\r\n\r\nAside from this, Dale has released more than forty original productions on labels like Nic Fanciulli\'s Saved Records, Fergie and Mr Henry Von\'s Tribal Rage, Nick Warren\'s Hope Recordings, Urban Torque and a host of others. With DJ support coming from tastemakers such as Carl Cox, Sasha, Laurent Garnier, Hernan Cattaneo and many more, Dale continues to stamp his sound on the scene. \r\n\r\nThese days Dale is based short term in Mumbai, where he is pushing the development of the house and techno scene in India, along with Anil Chawla and the boys at UnMute Agency.

Layering different sounds with the aid of two Pioneer CDJ-2000s, a Pioneer EFX-1000, Korg Kaossilator, MIDI controller and a laptop, his hands and ears don\'t let up for a second, leaving any punters feet a-moving and mouth a-gap. Zabiela’s demands for such a kit wherever he spins is a reminder that he\'s one of the scant few DJs who\'s pushing things forward in ‘09. James\' style is trippy, bleepy and deeply - nay, downright - groovy. Oh, and watch out for a few gnarly basslines along the way, those nasty, dirty sounds are a part of JZ\'s signature now. Scratches, loops, and fluttering chord changes are all par for the course in a Zabiela set.\r\nNo wonder childhood idols Depeche Mode remain his heroes - like fellow tech-house don Mathew Bushwacka!, they all understand that the best electronic music moves both heart and feet. And if the magic\'s there, the spirit will fly as well. \"Entertainment and education are the key,\" nods James sagely. \"It\'s all about finding the balance. People have paid good money to have a party but you still need a balance.\" Which is why his effects unit is so crucial to his performance. \"Anyone can mix two records to a degree,\" he grins, while still admitting to the odd bout of nervousness during radio interviews if not behind the decks. \"But I\'m a hundred times more confident than I used to be. DJing has definitely helped my confidence as a person.\" Watching him play, it’s easy to forget that making things look easy takes time to perfect. Zabiela’s crossed a few bridges - and a few national boundaries - along the way. \"I haven\'t worked it all out yet,\" he adds. \"But I do wish I could grow an extra arm sometimes!\" \r\nJames\' career so far has been stratospheric to say the least. Swiftly snapped up by Sasha\'s Excession agency, he spent the next year taking on Eastern Europe, Australia, South America and the US of A, while still finding time to record well-received CDs for Renaissance and unleash a string of fine remixes along the way. Royksopp, Ladytron and progressive artists Spooky have all been under the Zabiela scalpel - and more are on their way. Pushing the envelope while still learning to cope with a real-life fan base and life on the other side of the record counter, it’s unlikely that James Zabiela will be taking a breather anytime soon. There are further late niteries like Tribal Sessions and Matter to entertain and regular slots in Romania and Budapest to attend to. On a recent trip to Argentina he played a five-hour set in front of 6,500 screaming punters at Moonpark in Buenos Aires.

With over 10 million album sales and 30 produced mix compilations, John’s a proven musical pioneer whose essence lies in what his fans call, ‘the J00F sound’. The J00F sound is as unpretentious as the artist, and is best described as deep and textured progressively edged trance, in an electronic dance music style that is an antithesis to what is normally produced within the genre.\r\n\r\nIn an industry rife in self worship and mirror gazing, John is characterised by a passion and ability to connect audiences by injecting his unique underground musical style, and not his ego, into the mainstream vein. This connection has manifested in ten mix compilations and five singles in the UK Top 40 charts on iconic labels: Virgin, EMI and Warner Music. It has also seen him headline major events worldwide, seeing in over 10,000 appearances at the likes of Gatecrasher, Godskitchen, Ministry of Sound and Global Gathering, through to Holland’s Dance Valley, Serbia’s Exit Festival, Brazil’s Exxxperience, Australia’s Future music festivals, Belgium’s Tomorrowland, and the U.S.A’s Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC).\r\nJohn’s renown lies in his desire to give back to his fans. His much lauded 2010 BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix has spawned J00F Editions, an international tour which innovatively refocuses the music onto the club and its clubbers. J00F Editions resurrects the scene of old, and reintroduces the clubbing experience to extended sets, new sounds and new artists to deliver a true musical journey devoid of fluff and predictive cliché that has quickly gained international respect, residencies and support from other leading figures such as Dave Seaman, Avalon, Passion and Ministry of sound. JOOF Editions has been a huge success.\r\nJohn’s record label, J00F Recordings, and his monthly radio show, Global Trance Grooves, broadcast on iTunes, Ministry of Sound radio and DI. FM provides John another path to walk his own line. Here, he promotes rising stars in addition to giving over four million subscribed fans the latest in J00F’s inimitable sounds.\r\n\r\nJohn is also one of a select few endorsed by Pioneer. As the industry heavyweights inside every DJ booth, John provides subject matter expertise and consultancy in a partnership which ensures the upward evolution of the electronic music world’s tools of the trade.\r\nJohn’s esteem within the industry has garnered respect from electronica luminaries like Jean Michael Jarre and Simple Minds, and while humbly accepting peer endorsement he continues to let his production skills do the talking. Being humble John has never bragged the fact he writes music scores for the TV and movie world having music all over; BBC, NBC, Warner bros, Sony, ABC, Fax and more. Often being disgruntled with the commercial intrusion into the electronic John saved his writing skills for the media word, until recently where he has released an onslaught of chart topping releases, including his award winning debut album ‘Nine lives’ in 2011.\r\n\r\nJohn 00 Fleming is a performer who adroitly crafts something musically organic from the inorganic, artfully opening your senses into a genre far more pervasive than you currently know.

Although much of his music sounds like it was composed using equipment at the forefront of technology, it is not uncommon for him to use equipment now considered antique, such as the 1971 Korg micro synth that he used for portions of the second Prometheus album, Corridor of Mirrors.','','http://www.facebook.com/pages/Prometheus/106044109436531?ref=ts&rf=108230455871478','','','','0','0',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','dj-prometheus'),(1259,0,29,29,'Gandu Circus','We are a Post Punk Bangla rap band.\r\n\r\nWe have played at :\r\n20 - 22 May 2011 ESCAPE FESTIVAL, NAUKUCHIATAL\r\n23rd MAY 2011 THE LIVING ROOM, DELHI\r\n5 - 10 AUGUST 2011 KATOWICE, POLAND\r\n30th AUGUST 2011 ENLIGHTEN FESTIVAL, BOMBAY\r\n21st FEBRUARY 2012 CAW - ARTS & MUSIC FESTIVAL, CALCUTTA\r\n21st JUNE, 2012 BFI, SOUTHBANK, LONDON\r\n23rd JUNE, 2012 THE YARD, HACKNEY WICK, LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe film GANDU was made by Q in 2010, one of the most radical filmmakers in recent times.\r\n\r\nA collaboration between Q and two of the most promising musicians from India, Neel & Jiver and fuses rap & roll with heavy electronic grooves and projections from the film. \r\n','','http://www.facebook.com/GanduCircus','http://www.overdosejoint.in','','','0','0',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','gandu-circus'),(1260,0,104,104,'Cadent Slaves','Cadent Slaves is a Metal band from Hyderabad, India.

As time progressed, they slowly began playing shows around the city which included backyard shows and venues. After 4 months, Auggie decided to step aside and so a replacement was found. After multiple line-up changes and countless shows in the area, the line-up and sound Armament has established presently was established. The band now consist of singer/guitarist Albert G., drummer Ramon H., guitarist Frank A., and bassist Jorge G. The name was changed to Armament for simpler recognition and has therefore been established as a thrash band.\r\n\r\nThe band’s sound consists of multiple genres put together. Ramon, an ex funk and experimental drummer, brings in funk and groove to the sound. Frank sets the melodic tone of his progressive/technical metal concepts derived through a wide variety of his modern influences. Albert establishes his rhythmic sound established from influences such as Led Zeppelin, Kiss, Iron Maiden, etc. He sings with the ideas set by singers like Bruce Dickinson, Joey Belladonna, Frank Sinatra, etc. Bassist Jorge hardens the sound bringing in his punk influences such as The Adicts, The Exploited, and more. The sound has evolved from simple thrash sound to a more complex, experimental sound of thrash.\r\n\r\nThe band released an LP under the name Arsenal called “Prisoner in a Chamber” in 2009. Consisting of 8 songs, the band managed to sell minimal number of copies. Although proving to be a failure, the band continued to write music and developed their sound more into a stronger, darker sound. 2011 saw the release of Armament’s “Metal Anarchy” EP. Consisting of heavy riffing, fast tempo, and blistering musicianship, the EP has gotten great response and acceptance in the metal community. To date, more than 250 copies have been sold. A full length album is on the way with multiple shows planned in the near future.\r\nAlthough the band has come a long way since their foundation, the band continues to develop and create their sound.

Emerging from the depths of Bakersfield, California with a sound unlike any other in 1994, Korn have been able to cement themselves as one of the most important bands in rock n\' roll history.\r\n\r\nOver the course of eight full-length releases, Korn have sold in excess of 30 million albums and played countless sold-out shows worldwide. They\'ve won two Grammys—one for Best Short Form Video for \"Freak on a Leash\" from 1998’s Follow the Leader and one for Best Metal Performance for \"Here to Stay,\" from 2002’s Untouchables—and have launched a massively successful festival of their own, The Family Values Tour. However, despite all their massive success and accolades, Korn haven\'t lost hold of the savage, raw energy that made them such a crucial band for diehard rock and metal fans. Korn are one of the preeminent voices of this generation.\r\n\r\nTheir ninth offering, Korn III —Remember Who You Are, is their first effort for brand new label home, Roadrunner Records, and it bursts at the seams with that very feeling that defined the band from the get-go. Each song unleashes an uneasiness reminiscent of Korn\'s earliest and most unbridled material, but there’s also a modern refinement that\'s epic in its execution. Korn definitely don\'t lose sight of their roots on Remember Who You Are, but they also venture into uncharted darkness. All that truly matters is where they\'re going. The album strikes a balance between their past and their future, as it finds the band reuniting with producer Ross Robinson, who manned the boards for their first two records, all the while joining forces with Roadrunner Records, the world’s leading rock label.\r\n\r\nWith Korn III – Remember Who You Are, it\'s their time...\r\n\r\nKorn bleed with unsettling and unpredictable aggression on Remember Who You Are\'s 10 tracks. \"Oildale (Leave Me Alone)\" buzzes with an eerie clean guitar that slowly gives way to a steamrolling bass and riff assault. \"Move On\" morphs from a myriad of creaking tones into an explosive vocal freak-out that\'s impossible not to connect with it on a visceral level. Then there\'s the neck-snapping \"Fear Is A Place to Live\" tempering deadly guitar dissonance with an unforgettable chorus. This is Korn reborn.\r\n\r\n\"This album is a reflection of us being a band since 1993,\" says vocalist Jonathan Davis. \"We worked hard on the previous records, and we experimented a lot. For Remember Who You Are, the four of us got together in a small room with the intention of writing an old school Korn record. This album is a perfect mixture of everything we\'ve done, and this version of the band is the best ever.\" It\'s as if Korn revisited their storied beginnings, but as a wiser, tighter and more precise outfit blessed with the benefit of experience.\r\n\r\nIn order to tap into the chaos that made their self-titled debut a modern classic, the band enlisted the help of the man who helmed Korn and Life is Peachy—producer Ross Robinson, whose goal was to bring Korn back to square one. He undoubtedly succeeded. Davis had an intense and invigorating recording session. \"Ross helped us remember what we used to do this for,\" the singer says. \"It was more psychological than anything. Ross was right there pushing me and he drove me insane. I sing about a lot of things that hit really close to my heart and he knew how to trigger that. I nearly fucking broke down at the end of almost every song, but I got it all out.\"\r\n\r\nFor guitarist James \"Munky\" Shaffer, the experience was no different. He elaborates, \"Teaming up with Ross has brought that raw, emotional feeling back to the music. Ross is the only person in the world that\'s ever been able to draw us to that place. He reminds us why we\'re here, why these songs are important to our fans and why what we do as a band relates. He made us remember how our music saves lives, and he came into the picture at the perfect time. We had no record label and just wanted to make a great album. Ross stepped in at the right moment to hit the reset button.\"\r\n\r\nHitting that \"reset button\" involved stripping down the process. There would be no Pro-Tools, no tracking separately and no heavy post editing. In order to conjure Remember Who You Are\'s claustrophobic yet wholly organic chaos, Korn recorded on two-inch tape and locked themselves inside a 10x10 room buried within their Los Angeles studio, nicknamed \"The Cat Box.\" Being in such close proximity to one another stirred up a torrent of explosive music. Bassist Reggie \"Fieldy\" Arvizu remembers, \"In that room, even if I turned my bass head, it would hit somebody. Getting back in there was like a family reunion. We felt like brothers again. Being older and setting egos aside, we were able to focus on making the best record we could.\"\r\n\r\nDavis dug deep for cuts like \"The Past\" and \"Never Around.\" About \"The Past,\" the singer says, \"A lot of people dwell on the past, and they feel guilt. There\'s nothing you can do about the past because it\'s gone and it\'s blown up. We\'re here now.\" On Korn III – Remember Who You Are, Davis is fully present and at his most vitriolic, violent and vibrant on the likes of \"Move On\" and \"Are You Ready to Live?\"\r\n\r\nHe goes on, \"I let everything flow, while I was coming up with lyrics. They\'re about me living my life for others when I shouldn\'t, people-pleasing all of the time, stress, guilt and all kinds of emotions we live with everyday that destroy us and tear us down. I write about all of the fake people around us and how I always try to fix other people\'s problems. I write what I feel, and it comes out naturally. I\'ve got a lot of shit built up inside me; that doesn\'t go away.\"\r\n\r\nEven though Korn went back to square one, they continue to break new ground. In a career marked by innovation, they still smash boundaries. Munky even fingerpicks certain instrumental passages, while trying out new tones on echo-y soundscapes. \"The heavier I play, the more you can hear the aggression. The lighter I pick, the lighter the mood is,” he said. “I used vintage guitars, echos, long delays and reverbs. When we did the first two records, we broke the music down to a completely emotional beast. Through the years, we started to experiment with vocal harmonies and more orchestrated pieces. Recording this album, we brought that knowledge into the raw emotion of what we already knew. You hear the melodies and layers, but it still comes from a very primitive Korn.\"\r\n\r\nThat primitive Korn includes drummer Ray Luzier, who became Korn\'s touring drummer in late 2007 and was made an official member in 2009. On cuts like the deadly \"Fear Is A Place To Live,\" he propels the aggression. Fieldy says, \"Ray is like the missing Korn member we never had. He just fits so well. When we found him, it just clicked because his playing sounds like Korn. He plays with me, and the way that he plays is exactly what I needed. We know what we\'re doing on stage with each other, and everybody\'s on the same page. I\'ve waited my whole career for Korn to sound like we do now.\"\r\n\r\nKorn may have changed members with Brian \"Head\" Welch and David Silveria departing in 2005 and 2006 respectively, but Jonathan, Munky, Fieldy and Ray capture the feeling that was there in the beginning.\r\n\r\nFor Davis, the album name covers it all. \"It comes down to one question: \'Who the fuck am I?\' It\'s about remembering where we came from. The title sums up everything I\'m talking about lyrically. During the first two records, we were kids, and we didn\'t have anything. We were making music, having fun and not worrying. I went back to that place where I wasn\'t worried. I wanted to be completely honest with my feelings, express myself and let them out. People get so wrapped up in social communities, the Internet and technology that they forget who they are and what life\'s really about. I fucking forgot who I was until I did this record. This album is just a bass, a guitar, drums and my vocals. I look at the records we\'ve done as slots in time, and I believe Remember Who You Are is very special.\"\r\n\r\nThe album captures the band\'s legendary performance style that\'s ignited crowds worldwide on stages ranging from OZZfest and Projekt Revolution to Woodstock and Download. It\'s the same spirit that gave pop culture hits such as \"Blind,\" \"A.D.I.D.A.S.,\" \"Got the Life,\" \"Falling Away from Me\" and \"Twisted Transistor.\" It’s clear, however, that Korn III – Remember Who You Are is another thrilling chapter being etched into Korn’s already impressive history.\r\n\r\n\"There\'s that timeless space that we enter where nothing else matters on stage,\" says Munky. \"It\'s us, the crowd and the music. We lose track of where we are and who we are, and it\'s just a timeless shared space between us and the audience. We lose ourselves in the music. I want fans to lose themselves in the new music by forgetting about any problems or anything going on in their minds and let their hearts hear it. It\'s the same experience that I get when I\'m on stage.\"\r\n\r\nThe process brought them back to the beginning, but it also encouraged serious growth. Everyone is locked in like never before. Fieldy adds, \"We want to take you on a rollercoaster with this record. There are spacey and weird parts where the bass can breathe and there are some heavy moments. On Remember Who You Are, I\'m doing what I really wanted to do on our first record.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, this is for the people that made Korn—the millions of kids worldwide that buy every record, wear every shirt and never miss a show. Davis concludes, \"I love doing what I do. I love helping kids. I love hearing fans say, \'You got me through this or that.\' It makes me feel like I\'ve done something positive. I want kids to feel what I\'m saying and really hear it. I\'d love for the new songs to provoke them to think about what goes on around them. We\'re very fortunate to keep doing what we\'re doing, still be relevant and create music that invokes feelings from people.\"\r\n\r\nWith music this powerful, no one will ever forget who Korn are.','amy@roadrunnerrecords.com','http://www.facebook.com/korn','korn.com','','','0','0',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','korn'),(1279,0,2,2,'Hipnotribe','The band was formed in January 2008 by brothers Naresh and Paresh Kamath who felt they were missing out on the live gig action post Bombay Black!\r\n\r\nThe members of Hipnotribe are all heroes on their respective instruments.

Being the official World’s Most Popular DJ is just one of his many achievements, but the driving force behind his success is an overriding passion for dance music.\r\n\r\nA State of Trance\r\nThe Dutchman discovered a passion for dance music by listening to mix-tapes and radio shows, and taught himself how to create his own. 20 years later, his very own radio show A State of Trance has grown out to legendary heights. Nowadays, 15 million listeners tune into his 2 hour selection of trance and progressive, every week. For 9 years in a row and more than 450 episodes already, the A State of Trance show has been and still is a weekly highlight to many dance music lovers. \r\n\r\nAwards & Accolades\r\nEven a basic list of recent successes reads like a lifetime of work. Armin van Buuren isn’t ‘just’ the number one on the critically acclaimed DJ Mag Top 100, but also holds the ‘Best Global DJ’ and ‘Best Trance Artist’ title, awarded to him at the International Dance Music Awards and Beatport Awards, respectively. Radio show A State of Trance received the IDMA for ‘Best Mix Radio Show’ for 5 years in a row. Furthermore, Armin was awarded for ‘Best Podcast’, became the most popular International DJ at Australia\'s Sony inthemix DJ Poll and, in March 2010, received the ‘Gouden Harp’, the highest distinction a Dutch artist can get. \r\n\r\nAlbums\r\nArmin van Buuren has delivered four successful artist albums so far, ‘76’, ‘Shivers’, ‘Imagine’ and 2010 album \'Mirage\'. As the first dance artist in Dutch music history, his ‘Imagine’ entered the Dutch Album Top 100 Chart at number one. Hit singles ‘Going Wrong’, ‘In & Out of Love’, ‘Unforgivable’ and ‘Never Say Never’ didn’t only haunt the charts, but also became favourites of the dance crowd. The music video of ‘In & Out of Love’, featuring Dutch singer Sharon den Adel, received more than 67 million views on YouTube, holding the first position on the Dutch Top 10 of most viewed videos of all-time. Armin’s back catalogue, including ‘Blue Fear’, ‘Communication’, ‘The Sound of Goodbye’, ‘Shivers’, UEFA Youth Championship theme ‘Rush Hour’, ‘Burned With Desire’, ‘Exhale’, ‘Yet Another Day’ en ‘This World Is Watching Me’, is full of timeless tracks that wear that classic-tag and keep returning to the clubs. But, as a true artist befits, Armin keeps creating new music and has now released his fourth artist album, \'Mirage\'. For the album, Armin collaborated with the likes of BT, Christian Burns, Ferry Corsten, Adam Young and Nadia Ali. After the first single, ‘Full Focus’, the second release of the album was a collaboration with Sophie Ellis-Bextor, ‘Not Giving Up On Love’. The music video for the track was shot on party island Ibiza and includes shots of Club Amnesia, where Armin holds his residency. \r\n\r\nPerformances & Armin Only \r\nBeing the world\'s number 1 DJ sees the Dutch DJ perform at some of the world\'s biggest and best festivals, clubs, events and shows. One of the highlights of 2010 was Armin\'s DJ set at the Museumplein in Amsterdam in July, during the honoring of the Dutch soccer team. Even though the national team lost in the FIFA Worldcup, they partied like they were the absolute winners, and so did the 200.000 strong crowd. \r\n\r\nSold-out shows for Armin Only in 2005 and 2006 created eager anticipation of the third edition, which kicked off in a sold-out Jaarbeurs in Utrecht in 2008; over 16,000 fans attended and were enthralled by the DJ’s nine hour set, under the name of ‘Imagine’. For his fourth artist album, ‘Mirage’, Armin will kick off another Armin Only World tour. After the first show in the sold-out Jaarbeurs in Utrecht on November 13th, Armin will continue to travel the globe with shows in 15 different countries, ranging from Australia to Ukraine, Argentina, Libanon and more.

Watching the Monkees and Beatles cartoons regularly as a child made me want to play music and be a “rock star”. I began playing saxophone in the 4th grade and I bought my first guitar in 1989 and then my first drum kit in 1990. I played in heavy metal and punk bands on some combination of guitar, bass guitar, drums, and lead vocals from 1990-1996. I got a BA in music in 1999 and since then have been playing music in churches and rock bands. I recently made an 18 track CD of my own music. There is nothing like playing live though and Get Back gives me the opportunity to “get back” to the music that started it all for me!\r\n\r\nBill \"Slash\", \"Dr. Thunder\" Legg: Bass, Acoustic Guitar, Vocals\r\n\r\nI remember first hearing the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show, and the next day at school, that was all we could talk about. We played Please Please Me over and over again. My dad was a barbershop singer, and I was in the choir, so I was really taken by the Beatles’ great harmonies. I’ve been playing both classical and rock guitar since high school, and I really love the timelessness of the Beatles’ songs. They’re good songs, that’s why people are still playing them now.\r\n\r\nPrashant Marathay: Electric Guitar, Vocals\r\n\r\nAs I was growing up there was never much emphasis placed on the fine arts. We sang and played instruments only because it was a class in school. I discovered the Beatles in High School, and I listened to their songs on tape every day and night for over a year. I loved the melodies, the words, the complexity, the variety, I’ve been a fan ever since. We would sing Beatles songs on every road trip, much to the regret of our high school science teacher. I picked up the guitar because I wanted to play Ticket to Ride. The music kept pushing me to do more and more. The Beatles are really timeless. It’s great to play great music with great people. I hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoy playing it.\r\n\r\nRob \"Robtronic\" Miller: Lead Guitar, Harmonica\r\n\r\nAwaiting Bio from Rob.

Parisian Chris Carrier is among the latter. For more than a dozen years he\'s been an underground icon, churning out more than one hundred records and remixes for a host of labels. Too busy working to chase a spot in the limelight, Carrier is nevertheless rightly revered as one of the most gifted, prolific producers on the dance scene. Refusing to restrict his output to one genre or one school of thought, Carrier has dabbled freely in everything from house to hip hop, drum \'n\'bass to minimal, techno to electro. Most DJ shave one label - if at all - but Chris is so restlessly creative he\'s founded a whole fistful of labels over the course of his career, including the renowned Adult Only imprint, Chronobrain, Combustible, Taka, X86 and Direct Art. He has also worked under more than a fifteen aliases. However, youthful notions of being a baker (\"I like cakes,\" he says) lost out to music when he discovered the early 90s techno rave scene and began to DJ. Driven to be the master of his musical destiny, Chris quickly learned to produce and created pioneering techno outlet Chronobrain with Guillaume La Tortue. For seven-odd years Chris devoted himself the label, and its offshoots including house-oriented Taka and drum \'n\' bass imprint X86.However, his love for rave culture led him back towards more purely creative work. From 2003 onwards Chris has founded new labels Adult Only and Catwash, as well as bringing his vision to Get Physical, Crack & Speed, Brique Rouge, Robsoul, Kill Brique and - most recently - Freak n\' Chic. This has put the underground star firmly in the forefront of the new French electronic movement, bringing his diverse style to the sexy, deep, techy house vibes that dominate the scene. Chris is more sought-after than ever for his DJ skills - he\'s penetrated thenotorious US market with gigs in Georgia, San Francisco, Denver, Las Vegas and Miami. And plays in Europe\'s clubbing capitals: London, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam and Milan, to name a few. Look out for his gigs, and Chris\'s forthcoming remix of Matthew Dear\'s Dog Days - the first of many exciting projects for this unique artist in 2008.

Operating out of the city of Reeuwijk in western Holland, Steven’s flair for a beautiful melodic take on progressive trance has been welcomed with open arms from many thousands in the worldwide EDM scene.\r\n\r\nThe Early Years\r\n\r\nBorn just before Christmas in 1987, Steven was the youngest sibling of three brothers whom had a very healthy childhood and stable upbringing. The passion for music was always embedded in Steven’s characteristics as a child, but eventually it blossomed into a keen love for dance music one summer, in his teenage years, with a little help from ‘In Search of Sunrise’ by Tiesto & ‘A State of Trance’ from Armin van Buuren. Finding infectious interest in sound design and experimenting with FL Studio, it wasn’t long before Steven earned a highly respected position on Enhanced Recordings in 2007 with his first released production by ‘Estiva’ – ‘Estiva pres. Sunover –Stella’, a track that cemented a spot on the roster of the ever growing UK label, to which he is still loyal.\r\nAs things really started to move forward for Estiva, having released frequent tracks, the up & coming producer began to gain support from the very role models that first inspired him, achieving nothing short of a dream come true when a collaboration with Marninx named ‘‘Casa Grande’’ was handpicked for Tiesto’s 7th Edition of ‘In Search of Sunrise’ CD Series.\r\nFurther productions such as the “Strawberry Fields’’ EP and the “Les Fleurs” EP attracted attention from global superstars Tiesto, Armin, Ferry Corsten, & Markus Schulz, which was just a mark of Steven’s hard work in the studio and the intelligence in finding the catchy melodic progressive style that so many labels wanted a piece of, including Armada, Anjunabeats, Coldharbour, & Fraction.\r\nBetween 2009 and early 2010 another Estiva EP was released on Enhanced, “I Feel Fine” and yet again showcased Steven’s outstanding talents and again gathered big support, this time including Above & Beyond. The amazing collaboration with rising star Temple One ‘November lovely’ and more Estiva hits in the form of ‘Friends & Enemies’, ‘The Kingdom’, & ‘Adamas’ quickly became Estiva’s trademark pieces.\r\n\r\nProductions & Music\r\n\r\nIn more recent times Steven Baan has begun to unearth his own distinctive sound & style through carefully finding the perfect balance between danceable beats and melodic emotion, using desirable techniques and skills to find the edge in his productions that are nothing short of superb in today’s trance & progressive industry. Prior to Estiva’s ‘Festival EP’ in early 2011, Steven had already gained support from the greats including Armin van Buuren & Above & Beyond continuingly making trance headlines with huge productions since his start in 2007, although none of which planted enormous interest in the newly branded ‘Estiva’, on a global scale, as ‘Festival’, ‘Lotus’ & ‘Make A Wish’ did. From there on out, Estiva has continued along the path to higher success showcasing his musical talent in many remixes not forgetting the huge chart topper single ‘Next Level’. Arguably the biggest Estiva production to date, came in the form of ‘Better Days’ featuring the outstanding Josie, a beautiful vocalist from the USA and also sister of the one and only Jaren, creditable to tracks such as Unforgettable, Beggin’ You & Man on The Run. With the success of this release almost immeasurable; all the while Steven gained experience in vocal production and shooting music videos during an overwhelming performance in the North of England, all combining to cement his print on the ever competitive music scene.\r\nAccelerating progress in the studio over the years has been undeniable, which was reflected by Estiva’s Perfect Ten digital compilation hosted by Enhanced Music. The concept featured ten of the most popular Estiva tracks voted for by thousands of fans, also including an exclusive Estiva rework of ‘I Feel Fine’, the track which received the highest percentage of votes.\r\nThe next step on the cards for the young tangible talent is his debut artist album having been working on ideas over the past year. This really will be the ‘next level’ for Estiva in what seems a fast flowing journey to the top of the electronic dance podium and will mark only the beginning of a hugely triumphant music career.\r\n\r\nPerformances & Schedule\r\n\r\nEstiva joined Assured Artists in 2010 and since then, he has become one of the most sort after names on the Assured roster. Since, landing massive gigs from Cyprus to Los Angeles last year, Estiva has established himself as a highly charismatic DJ that personalizes each performance through emotional attachment to the audience. “The most special part of playing music that I have written & produced, is that it’s personal to me, and to see people enjoying when I play it, creates an amazing connection between myself and the crowd.” One highlight for Estiva was the huge performance at global electronic dance festival, Nature One, having played to an overwhelming crowd of 5,000 people.\r\nSome years back, being a part of the Luminosity line-up ‘Before the Energy’ in 2009 in Utrecht, The Netherlands, was a huge leap into the premier league of DJ performances for the young Estiva. At present, having performed at Armin van Buuren’s groundbreaking ASOT500 celebration, also in Holland in 2011, Estiva has firmly established himself as one of the most popular DJ’s in the trance & progressive genre.\r\nHaving also appeared at Gatecrasher, alongside Armin in Germany and at Digital Society over in the UK, Estiva’s schedule has almost fully fledged of late, meaning DJ appearances in North America, Mexico, South Africa, Indonesia, and all over Europe, which judging by achievements so far, is only the beginning for the ever so talented individual.','steven@estiva-music.com','http://www.facebook.com/EstivaOfficial','http://www.estiva-music.com','','','','0',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','estiva'),(1318,0,0,0,'Thompson Andrews','Thomson Andrews is an Indie Contemporary R&B Singer/Songwriter, performer and a Recording Artist.

Though a simple thing like organizing a western music concert here is still very hard to do given the state of affairs, we are determined to make a change and are doing so by creating music that incorporates the heavy sounds of metal and our own tribal tunes and melodies. Whether we get to play this music in our hometown is to be seen but that is not something holding us back!\r\n\r\nThough Tripura is not a place known for western music, being young we hope we can bring some change in the mindset of the people living here.\r\n\r\nThe three songs you hear, are the fist oc\'s that we made, hope you guys like them.

His progressive techno style is championed by fellow artists and clubbers alike, while demand for his DJ skills have seen Henri play at some of the best clubs on the global dance scene. 2012 looks set to get even better with several new releases ready to go and increasing support for his label, Replug Records.\r\n\r\nBorn in Finland, raised in Sweden and now based back in Tampere in Finland, Henri began making music in the early \'90s. He first came to prominence when he teamed up with Mathias Bradler to create Mashtronic in 2004, and their productions and hectic DJ schedule soon brought them to an international audience. As well as playing all over Europe and trips to South America, Australia and New Zealand, Mashtronic signed their productions to several of the best labels including Bedrock and Global Underground.\r\n\r\nWith such strong credentials behind him, Henri\'s career as a solo artist hit the ground running. Starting with the \'Sister\' EP on Dyami in 2008, Henri has put together an impressive body of work including releases, collaborations and remixes on labels like Baroque, Inkfish, Tribal Vision, microCastle, Afterglow, AlterImage, Sudbeat, Mcgroove, Flow Vinyl, Iboga and Epsilon Trax. The word prolific hardly does it justice with over 40 Cid Inc original productions and remixes to date, and it\'s not surprising Beatport selected Henri as one of their Progressive House Artists of 2009 alongside other great names like Charlie May, Guy J and Pole Folder.\r\n\r\nIn October 2009 Henri launched Replug Records dedicated to releasing both his own and music from other artists. Cid Inc tracks include \'Defrost\', \'Cloudberries\', \'Filaments\', Caustic\' and \'Blizzard\' alongside contributions from Rich Curtis, Deepfunk and more. There\'s also been the \'Replugged Vol. 1\' compilation, and Henri has a keen eye for signing new talent. Pretty much every Cid Inc hits the upper reaches of the Beatport progressive chart, and Hernan Cattaneo, John Digweed, Nick Warren and Henry Saiz are just a few of the DJs who regularly include Henri\'s tracks in their sets.\r\n\r\nIncreased recognition of his productions over the last two years has provided Henri with a busy DJ diary and he regularly plays all over the world. Highlights from the last 12 months include Exit in Lithuania, the Volt Club in Greece, the Teleportation Festival and Fakel beach party in Russia, and Bahrein in Argentina. August 2011 saw Henri return to the famous B 018 club in Beirut where he played for over four hours, and future bookings include the Spirit of Colours festival in Mexico and the John Digweed after party in Helsinki.\r\n\r\n\"Hypnotic progressive house with a touch of techno and deeper sounds is the music I like to play,\" explains Henri. \"It\'s that hypnotic feel I look for in music. Trips to London, Germany, Spain, Russia, India, South America, Canada and the USA are already being lined up for the coming months as word spreads that Henri\'s skills behind the decks equal those in the studio. He is also part of the recently launched Global Underground World Tours roster.\r\n\r\nThere\'ll be no stopping Henri in 2012 and forthcoming releases in his packed production schedule include the \'Emotional Self\' EP with Lank on microCastle as well as remixes for Henry Saiz\'s Natura Sonoris label, Luis Junior\'s new imprint Mooseekaa, Plastik Park, Flow Vinyl and Australian label Subsonic Music.

BLAKC is a band from Mumbai made up of five very unique, talented individuals. They are (in no order of importance) Shawn Pereira, Shishir Thakur, Roop Thomas, Rein Dias and Anish Menon. Before we get to know them better, let’s see how BLAKC was first formed. \r\n\r\nIn early 2006, Shawn was a fun-loving college-going kid. His priorities in life were to attend as little college as possible while meeting as many women as possible. He decided the way to go was to be a rockstar. Enter Anish, another fun-loving, college-going kid. He wanted to be a high flying guy in the corporate world. So much so that he actually turned up for one of BLAKC’s gigs at a later time in a suit, and then left without playing. But he too wanted to be a rockstar. They made a lot more money and did a lot less to earn it. Anyway, Anish met Shawn and concluded that they might just have something in common. So they got together with Gaurav and Vishwanath (who then formed Red Cube after they left BLAKC) and Sylvester, Shawn’s guitarist-friend. They jammed for a week, entered into a competition under the supposedly temporary name of BLAKC and came third in a college competition and the name stuck. \r\n\r\nTowards the end of 2006, Gaurav and Nath were replaced by Roop and Shishir and BLAKC started composing its own music. In February 2007, Reinhardt replaced Sylvester and the lineup was complete. BLAKC went on to win a local college competition and that’s where it all began. \r\n\r\nIn the past three years that BLAKC has been around with its present lineup, they participated in a lot of local college competitions. After making it to the finals of both IRock and Campus Rock, they graduated to opening and headlining shows in Mumbai as well as other cities. Today BLAKC has played over eighty shows across 14 cities in India. \r\n\r\nBLAKC released their debut album \'Choking On A Dream\' in December 2008. The album DID NOT sell out like crazy :) but the general consensus (fans and critics alike) is that BLAKC is definitely a band to watch out for. Lucky enough to sell around 700 cds. The band is currently writing new music for their second album and has no plans to allow life as such to disrupt the crazy life they are living. \r\n\r\n“BLAKC has always been about two things, the music and the people. We believe that our music is an extension of our personalities and the only way to connect to so many music lovers. Off stage we are weird; on stage we can tear a place apart purely because of the energy we have. BLAKC since its beginning has been unable to fit into genres, we stopped trying and stuck to doing what we loved doing more than any other which is making our own music. We each have such various influences that every song has multiple personalities. We love what we do and we love that you like us enough to have read this.

His early years were spent growing up in a family of music and musicians. His father Ustaad Shujaat Khan is today one of the most sought after musicians of our time. His grandfather Ustaad Vilayat Khan is considered to be the legend of the sitar. This makes Azaan the 8th generation of Ustaad Imdaad Khani gharana of music. \r\n\r\nAzaan studied at the Mother International School, where his inclination towards music started taking shape. He bought his beginners guitar and enrolled at the Delhi School of Music. \r\nSoon after this, at the age of 14, his interest in music turned into a passion, and he started performing at various school festivals. He started evolving in several different directions within the world of music. As he turned to a new mentor, Mr.Gussy Rikh, who was the lead guitarist of the band Euphoria, to teach him techniques of the electric guitar. Also, all throughout his formative years, the Riyaaz sessions held at home, where his father taught difficult compositions (bandishes) to his senior students, took deep roots within him, which allowed him to sing these bandishes with ease. The unique blend of having the knowledge of western classical as well as Indian classical music helped him to make his own niche in the young world of upcoming college musicians. \r\n\r\nIn the past couple of years, Azaan has found different facets to his musical creativity. He has started writing his own lyrics, he composes all his music and he sings and plays the guitar in all his compositions, the uniqueness being that he is actually comfortable doing all this in western and Indian music. At the moment, he is working on his first album, where he is bringing together this four dimensional creativity. Many aspects of Indian and folk music are predominant in his compositions, in addition to which he has enthused the western characteristics of compositions like harmonies and chords. Many elements of Sufi\'ism are also visible in his work. \r\n\r\nAlthough he has performed many times in college cultural festivals, he has even accompanied his father Ustaad Shujaat Khan in concerts. Notable amongst them are events in New York in July, where he played for the United Nations world Hindi Conference, New Delhi in august at the India Habitat Centre. In the same year, he has also toured Mauritius and South Africa. The following winter, he performed in Delhi for a gala charity event to raise funds for Smile India. Apart from this, he performed in numerous different venues in India and abroad. \r\n\r\nIn the summer 2009, Azaan joined the prestigious \"KMMC\" which is AR Rahman’s music conservatory in Chennai., where he took courses in Hindustani and western vocal amongst other subjects such as music theory, music history, appreciation and sound and audio engineering. \r\n\r\nAzaan will soon be shifting to Mumbai permanently to start work with the composing duo Salim-Suleman on various different projects.\r\nArtists We Also Like\r\npink floyd, porcupine tree,dream theater, sqaurepusher, john mayer','','https://www.facebook.com/pages/Azaan-Khan/152988211399869','','','','','0',0,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:31','2012-09-06 07:27:31',0,'','','azaan-khan'),(1352,0,0,0,'Bassista V ','From Mountain Madness in Nepal to the beaches of Goa, Vandana is making waves with sounds that keep you hooked and grooving.

Vandana has traveled widely and been personally involved with multiple genres of music, ranging from rock to funk, fusion, jazz and blues. However, her world turned around when she first experienced electronic music. Soon she began performing as a DJ experimenting with a unique style of dark, tribal and bass-heavy EDM (sub-genre no bar). She has since performed alongside some of the world\'s best international artists like Sultan, Ned Shepard, DJ Pearl, Atmos, Fatali, Kashyyyk, Manuel de la Mare, Nikhil Chinapa, Mad Maxx and Paul Thomas, and has frequented some of the best venues India has to offer.

Marlon was already Dj-ing for a while and Ralph experimented a lot with making different kinds of dance music. Marlon was mainly playing house music at the time and then the idea came to push Ralphs productions in that direction so that Marlon could play the tracks in his sets. The first track they were both satisfied with was “Beat Cut”.\r\n\r\n“Beat Cut” got picked up by Fedde le Grand and kickstarted their career. What followed was a solid stream of tracks and remixes which were supported by all the top jocks and scored big on the international dance charts, like for example their remix for Dada Life which scored #1 on hypem.com (the international hype machine). The success in the studio was also taken to the clubs and with a packed schedule of 250 gigs a year Bassjackers were definitely established in the dance scene.\r\n\r\nTheir BIG break came in 2011, their dancefloor bomb “Mush Mush” got picked up by Tiesto and got released on Tiesto’s imprint “Musical Freedom”. It dominated the Beatport top 10 for over 2 months and grew to be one of the biggest club/festival tracks of 2011. It’s that track that every DJ can play to destroy the dance floor, and so they did.

When he turned 18, Rick Smith invited him to become the third member of techno band Underworld. 1993\'s dubnobasswithmyheadman was their commercial breakthrough onto the then burgeoning British electronica scene. While working on their second album, 1996\'s Second Toughest in the Infants, they released the single \"Born Slippy\", which was an instant hit following its inclusion on the soundtrack to the movie, Trainspotting. During his time with Underworld, the band released three albums and sold over a million albums world wide.\r\nEmerson also emerged as a much sought-after remix talent, with remixes for such diverse acts as The Chemical Brothers, and Björk.\r\nDarren parted ways with Underworld in 2000 and then concentrated more on his solo career as a DJ and remixer, and also a label owner. He continued to release tracks by himself and new artists on the Underwater records label and eventually gained its own night at super club Pacha, Ibiza alongside fellow DJ Erick Morillo. During its second summer at Pacha, his Underwater Records night won \'House Event\' of the summer at the DJ Magazine awards.

Olaf Dieckmann) has been supplying the world’s dancefloors with audio titans for close to 15 years. Most recently renowned for his neoclassical- anthems „Chakalaka“ and „Pong“, later receiving IDMA 2010 nomination as Best Progressive House Track alsongside David Guetta and Deadmau5. Wippenberg’s music hazes the\r\nmultiple boundaries of house, electro, trance and techno. This unique composite electronic blend\r\nis now spun by the widest imaginable cross-section of DJs. He’s championed as much by Eric\r\nPrydz, Angelo, Ingrosso & Axwell (also known as the Swedish House Mafia), as he is by Tiësto,\r\nArmin Van Buuren and David Guetta. This casts Wippenberg as one of, if not, the most diverse\r\nDJ/producer in today’s EDM universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2004 Wippenberg released the two ‘Elemental EPs’, which included the tracks ‘Fire’, ‘Water’,\r\n‘Earth’ and ‘Air’. They drew strong support from the highest echelons of the DJ hierarchy and\r\npushed the Wippenberg name firmly into the headlines. The EPs release prompted close associates Cosmic Gate to collaborate with Wippenberg on their ‘Earth Mover’ album with the track ‘Guess Who’. Around the same time he completed work on his next single ‘Promised Land’, and with it came a new label relationship with Dutch heavyweight independent High Contrast Records. The track (which featured the vocals of Tiff Lacey and was remixed by Nic Chagall) beat the drum hard for what was to prove his renaissance record.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 ‘Chakalaka’ (partnered by the B-side ‘Drumster’) exploded into the clubbing consciousness, thanks in no small part to major 3 monthlong floor and radio hammering from Tiësto and Armin Van Buuren. As was always Wippenberg’s desire the tracks started to chip away at the stylistic borders of dance and came to enjoy heavy deck support from Sebastian Ingrosso, Eric Prydz, Eric Morillo and Dirty South, amongst a multitude of others. The track maintained a grip on the No.1 chart position on Beatport for an incredible 12 weeks. Late that year and branching further out still, Wippenberg launched a new nom-de-plume Sphaera. The tracks ‘Front & ‘Back’ were released on\r\nBlack Hole Records to, once again, broad DJ acclaim.\r\n\r\nFamously, Wippenberg carved his name deep into the heart of the mid-90s dancefloor with his very\r\nfirst track - the unforgettable, speaker-assaulting ‘Neurodancer’. Released on Hyper Hype, it\r\nbecame an import smash and was picked up by Hooj Choons off-shoot Prolekult. To this day\r\n‘Neurodancer’ rests as one of the hardest-to-find and most in-demand pieces of dance vinyl in the\r\nworld - regularly changing hands for many times its original price.\r\nNo Wippenberg biography would be complete without mention of Wippenberg\'s remix and spinning work. Behind the decks his characteristic musical taste, which can be categorised into one certain genre, as he loves the freedom to mix different stlyes, has started to generate huge demand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he is touring all around the world from Germany to Russia, from Australia to Brazil, even\r\nthe people of India or Qatar fell in love with the Wippenberg sound. It has seen him blaze a trail at\r\nEurope’s leading festival events like Trance Energy, Mayday or Mysteryland and rock at Armin Van\r\nBuuren’s ASOT400, as well as dozens of other, clubs, festivals and tent-poles events.\r\nAt the remix end of the mixing desk, Wippenberg has refashioned countless tracks of A-List\r\nproduction outfits, like Sebastian Ingrosso’s MGMT ‘Kids’ sampling classic-tune „Kidsos“ and\r\nRank 1’s Trance Energy 2009 anthem ‘L.E.D. There Be Light’. But he also refined releases from\r\nTiësto, Tocadisco, Above & Beyond, Paul Van Dyk, Cosmic Gate, Gabriel & Dresden, and\r\nSuper8 & Tab. Most recently he remixed danish high-flyer Aura Dione’s new single „Song For\r\nSophie“ and gave her pop-ballade a classy progressive house outfit.\r\n\r\nFor his new single he teamed up with nobody else than Nic Chagall and Rank 1. Together they\r\ncreated the track „100“ (which is also the 100th release of the label High Contrast). It has the typical\r\nRank 1 anthem signature, Nic Chagall’s progressive trance feeling and Wippenberg’s progressive\r\nbeats.

In 2002, he left London to live in Ibiza , and spent the next 3 years co-producing music with artists such as Earthling, Soundaholics, CampoSonic (Celli Earthing, Bushman and Paul Taylor). Whilst in Ibiza he also joined Spun Records as Label Dj and A&R, and compiled the top selling Spun Compilation:\'Tweakers\'.

His first Artist album: \"HIGH LIFE\" received excellent reviews and sold out soon after it\'s December 2008 release...this album defined a whole new sound in the Psy Trance scene, which was further explored in his 2009 release: \"PURITY\". \r\nBoth Albums having served as catalysts in redefining the ever changing sound of the World\'s Trance Scene. So after getting so much positive feedback from both Producers and Fans, it seemed a logical progression to commission some of Paul\'s favorite fellow Producers to undertake Remixes of various tracks from these last 2 releases.\r\n\r\nThe concept behind these Remixes was to once again \"push the boat right out\" with the Minimalistic Full-On formula ,so successfully introduced in those last two albums.\r\n\r\nProducers such as Tron, Mental Broadcast, Chameleon and Kronic , were chosen for their ability to bring something new and extra to the table,and to breathe 2010/2011 production standards into these well proven dancefloor hits . Upon having heard the first remixes come in, Paul was so impressed and inspired, that he decided to write a further 4 original new tracks to complement these Remixes ,thus creating a combined ReMix and new material release to be known as \"REDUX\".\r\n\r\nOnce again this release looks set to raise the bar higher yet again, adding a further chapter in Paul\'s ongoing re-invention of the Psy Trance medium. \r\nDue out late February 2011 on Kundalini Records U.K....

Becoming PLAYMATE of the year 2006 for the Hungarian Playboy and 2007 for the Italian issue of the infamous mag are considered as milestones of her modeling career.\r\n\r\nSoon bored by the monotony of \"just\" being a model, where she achieved a lot already, she felt like looking for another aim in entertainment and decided to follow her father\'s footsteps in becoming a DJ. 2009 and 2010 Djane Kekka was booked in almost every club in Hungary and Italy and soon invited to perform abroad.\r\n\r\nTouring the US with stops in New York, Las Vegas, Miami and Boston was a great experience in her young career and more international appearances came soon.

Recently Djane Kekka toured an all summer tour in Hungary and Spain again and is to guest in the South of Germany.\r\n\r\nProducing music by herself, she expresses that her definition of House and Electro music is one of the greatest things to do for her.

His initial training has been in Indian classical and traditional music (devotional and folk) from Assam a region in the north eastern corner of India, sharing its borders and culture with the very oriental - Bhutan, China, Myanmar and Bangladesh.

Gainsbourg\'s extremely varied musical style and individuality make him extremely difficult to categorise. His legacy has been firmly established, and he is often regarded as one of the world\'s most influential popular musicians.\n\nHis lyrical brilliance in French has left an extraordinary legacy. His music, always progressive, covered many styles: jazz, ballads, mambo, lounge, reggae, pop (including adult contemporary pop, kitsch pop, ye-ye pop, \'80s pop, pop-art pop, prog pop, space-age pop, psychedelic pop, and erotic pop), funk, disco, calypso, Africana, bossa nova, and rock n\' roll. He has gained a following in the English-speaking world with many non-mainstream artists finding his arrangements highly influential.\n\nProduction company \'Stiff Kittens Inc\' (Medicine Show, Ska! Ska! Ska!) have put together a revue with a strong line up of 13 musicians and dancers featuring 25 songs of the French composer. As well as Gainsbourg, songs of his that were originally performed by artists such as Brigitte Bardot, Francoise Hardy, Jane Birkin and France Gall will be interpreted by various singers. Expect to hear classic songs such as Initials BB, Intoxicated Man, La Javanaise, Histoire de Melody Nelson, Laisse tombeur les filles, 69 anee erotique, Je T’Aime..Mon Non Plus, Lemon Incest, Bonnie and Clyde etc.','','','','Wild City',NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:33','2012-09-06 07:27:33',0,'','','','2012-06-21 05:05:48','2012-06-21 10:05:48','stiff-kittens-presents-an-homage-to-serge-gainsbourg',1,NULL),(3,'TOCADISCO (GERMANY)','Tocadisco celebrates over 15 years of international DJ stardom.

They have also won numerous awards, including an Asia-wide MTV Video Music Award for their song “Pretty Child.” Among a host of other achievements, Indus Creed jammed live with GunsN’Roses guitar player Slash, shared the stage with Bon Jovi to more than 50,000 people in Bombay and was invited to play at Peter Gabriel’s prestigious WOMAD festival in the UK.

The trailblazers of the Indian rock movement return in a new, contemporary form. Call it IC 2.0 or Indus Creed in new form. Either way, Uday Benegal, Mahesh Tinaikar and Zubin Balaporia, the original frontman, guitar player and keyboard player of the pioneering band, are focused on the task at hand: to break new ground even as they slam it out.\r\n\r\nIt\'s been just over 10 years since Indus Creed shut shop. Many were perplexed as to why a band would suddenly call it a day at the peak of their success. After all, they were the first name on the lips of every Indian rock fan, with hits, awards and accolades stacked high and still climbing. Reasons and theories abound, but the truth is simple. The fellers were unhappy with the way the music biz in India was heading. It had become corporatized, crass and stifling. Additionally, they had reached a point individually where they wanted to explore different directions...musically and geographically.\r\n\r\nUday and guitarist Jayesh Gandhi went West, moving to New York City in 1999 with their newly formed Indo-rock and funk outfit Alms For Shanti. Nine years and many gigs later Uday returned to Bombay, where Mahesh and Zubin had remained. The axeman and keyboard wiz had both been busy too, separately making music as producers and collaborators in the studios, as well as with other bands. Uday and Mahesh first joined together with their acoustic band Whirling Kalapas, which began to make waves the moment they hit the stage. Zubin used to drop in to play the occasional gig with them. Inevitably, though, the three rockers couldn\'t resist crankin\' it out loud...and the new Indus Creed was born.\r\n\r\nFresh blood was needed to get this baby off the ground. Recruiting the rock-solid bass wunderkind Rushad Mistry was a no-brainer. A seasoned sideman and stalwart of a thousand and some gigs, Rushad has played with an impossibly diverse array of bands, artists and ensembles. Jai Row Kavi was an equally obvious selection. The 23-year-old powerhouse drummer can not only wack the bejeebers out of a drumkit, he can go from 0 to 60 at light speed while singing a Carnatic operetta in perfect falsetto.

The trailblazers of the Indian rock movement return in a new, contemporary form. Call it IC 2.0 or Indus Creed in new form. Either way, Uday Benegal, Mahesh Tinaikar and Zubin Balaporia, the original frontman, guitar player and keyboard player of the pioneering band, are focused on the task at hand: to break new ground even as they slam it out.\r\n\r\nIt\'s been just over 10 years since Indus Creed shut shop. Many were perplexed as to why a band would suddenly call it a day at the peak of their success. After all, they were the first name on the lips of every Indian rock fan, with hits, awards and accolades stacked high and still climbing. Reasons and theories abound, but the truth is simple. The fellers were unhappy with the way the music biz in India was heading. It had become corporatized, crass and stifling. Additionally, they had reached a point individually where they wanted to explore different directions...musically and geographically.\r\n\r\nUday and guitarist Jayesh Gandhi went West, moving to New York City in 1999 with their newly formed Indo-rock and funk outfit Alms For Shanti. Nine years and many gigs later Uday returned to Bombay, where Mahesh and Zubin had remained. The axeman and keyboard wiz had both been busy too, separately making music as producers and collaborators in the studios, as well as with other bands. Uday and Mahesh first joined together with their acoustic band Whirling Kalapas, which began to make waves the moment they hit the stage. Zubin used to drop in to play the occasional gig with them. Inevitably, though, the three rockers couldn\'t resist crankin\' it out loud...and the new Indus Creed was born.\r\n\r\nFresh blood was needed to get this baby off the ground. Recruiting the rock-solid bass wunderkind Rushad Mistry was a no-brainer. A seasoned sideman and stalwart of a thousand and some gigs, Rushad has played with an impossibly diverse array of bands, artists and ensembles. Jai Row Kavi was an equally obvious selection. The 23-year-old powerhouse drummer can not only wack the bejeebers out of a drumkit, he can go from 0 to 60 at light speed while singing a Carnatic operetta in perfect falsetto.

Whether it be his sensual, hypnotic take on house music, his deeply textured techno or his wondrous ambient material, his work is always touched with a magic and emotion that few rival.\r\n\r\nGuy started producing at the age of 14, amassing a wealth of equipment and experience and dedicating his life to learning the craft (“my friends called my room ‘the cave’”). His first release came at the age of 21, but it was his 2007’s gem Save Me that proved to be his real launchpad. John Digweed snapped up the glistening, dramatic slice of deeper house music up for his legendary Bedrock Records, setting in motion a chain of events that would change his life forever. “It was like a dream coming true. I never knew it would lead me to having two albums on a label that I really grew up with.”\r\n\r\nNever one to be pigeonholed, his portfolio is a diverse beast, with releases finding their way onto Tiga’s increasingly eclectic Turbo imprint amongst others. To feature on two labels that are essentially synonymous with two very different scenes is testament to his versatility, and above all, the quality and conviction of his productions. “I don\'t see myself as producer of one genre only; I believe in exploring and trying different stuff when you have all the tools you need to create” he clarifies. “To be signed to Turbo... it’s also amazing as it a big label that has its own crowd of people who listen to a certain type of music, and to be part of it is great.”\r\n\r\n2012 sees Guy kick off an exciting new project with his close colleagues and friends at Bedrock: his very own imprint “Lost & Found”, a sub-label for John Digweed’s long running mothership where he’ll release music by himself and his favourite producers. Then there’s the small matter of a release on Cocoon, one of the most highly regarded labels in techno and beyond, and some exciting collaborations in the pipeline with some other inspiring artists. As always with this unique talent, it’s quality, not quantity. Each of his releases is met with a swell of anticipation, and for once in this often over-hyped world, it’s fully justified.','','','','Wild City',NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:33','2012-09-06 07:27:33',0,'','','','2012-07-07 02:05:00','2012-07-07 10:05:48','guy-j-kohra-blot-dj-set',1,NULL),(33,'THE FRINGE','The Fringe is a band that formed in early 2010.

DJ PEZ RODRIGUEZ & FLEXI K','DJs Pez Rodriguez and Flexi K will be spinning classics from the golden age of Hispanic dance music.\r\n\r\nMambo is one of the greatest Latin music rhythms ever created. Originally from Cuba, this genre was also responsible for shaping the sounds of modern Salsa music.\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\nA Potted History of The Mambo\r\nIn the 1930s, Cuban music was heavily influenced by Danzon. One of the popular bands at that time was the orchestra of Arcaño y sus Maravillas; some of its members introduced variations to the classic beat of Danzon. They Orestes Lopez and Israel \"Cachao\" Lopez. In 1938, they produced a Danzon single entitled Mambo.\r\n\r\nThe Lopez brothers incorporated a heavier African beat into their music. This new type of Danzon, which is at the base of Mambo music, was known at that time as Danzon de Nuevo Ritmo. Sometimes, it was simply called Danzon Mambo.\r\n\r\nAfter Mambo\r\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw the golden years of Mambo. Nevertheless, these years were rapidly overcome by the development of Salsa, a new crossover experiment that borrowed elements from different Afro-Latin rhythms like Son, Charanga and of course, Mambo. The influence of Mambo in Salsa is a significant one. Besides Salsa, Mambo also played a significant role in the development of another popular Cuban invention, Cha Cha Cha. For everything it accomplished, Mambo is definitely one of the most successful creations in Latin music.','','','','The Wild City',NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:33','2012-09-06 07:27:33',0,'','','','2012-07-05 09:05:00','1970-01-01 05:35:00','mambo-feat-dj-pez-rodriguez-flexi-k',1,NULL),(140,'Franks got the funk','\"Frank is an idea.

Think velvety vocals, think trippy music, think melodies that will surprisingly dance on your lips while you take a shower the morning after the gig, think lyrics that will surprise you with their simple profoundness-that’s Nirmika & The Few Good Men for you.\r\n\r\nDon’t be surprised if the band gets you an adrenaline rush with one song and leaves you in a contemplative space with the next. But be surprised if they don’t make you happy, because that’s what they’re best at. With heavy strokes of pop-rock, jazz and reggae, their music might make you want to consider forgiving your crazy boss for his eccentricity or even convince you to take your lover for a walk on the beach.

The Ska Vengers, Bombay Bassment, Blek, Gandu Circus, Delhi Sultanate, Samara C, BBC at Blue Frog','The Ska Vengers\r\nska/sk?/–noun: a modern style of Jamaican popular music, which emerged in the 1950s as a blend of African-Jamaican folk music, calypso, and American jazz and rhythm and blues, notable for its fast shuffling, scratchlike tempo and jazzlike horn riffs with a heavy accent on the  offbeat. \r\n\r\nThe Ska Vengers is a new Delhi based band that blends ‘ska’ rhythms with elements of dub, punk, jazz and rap to come up with a form of music that is refreshingly different, energetic and highly danceable. Keys man, Stefan Kaye rounded up a few of his musician friends to form the band in the fall of 2009. \r\n\r\nBombay Bassment\r\nBombay Bassment was perhaps Indian indie music’s most pleasant surprise of the last 12 months. A group that by their own description is closer to The Roots than to 50 Cent, and has been winning new fans with every gig they play. “We wanted to make it a band because the kind of hip hop we appreciate is closer to what you could call old school,” said rapper and de facto frontman Robert “Bob” Omulo. \r\n\r\nBBC\r\nVoted # 1 Drum N Bass / Dubstep DJ by MyFavDJ.in for 2009 - 2010, BBC (Bay Beat Collective) is Kris Correya, Sohail Arora & Raffael Kably. The Mumbai-based BBC (Bay Beat Collective) formed in response to the abundance of standard-issue electronica so commonly heard in clubs and bars across the country. A DJ collective currently consisting of Kris Correya, Sohail Arora & Raffael Kably, the BBC\'s passion lies in drum & bass, breaks, dubstep, glitch, funk and minimal sounds. \r\n\r\nBLEK\r\nBLEK (fomerly Blech) is an all original alternative trio with no idea of what their genre really is. This 3 piece act is made up of Jared Creado on the bass, Varoon Aiyer (Split) on drums, and Rishi Bradoo on guitars and vocals. \r\n\r\nTheir meeting was a result of idleness, flunky frustration, and the failure of one of them to speak un-anglicized Hindi. Each of them brings a different style and influence to their music. Rolling Stone magazine refers to them as the \"Bombay based cousins of The Supersonics\" and the best way to experience this band is to watch them perform live while they execute their trade-marked monkey dance.','','','','blueFrog',NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:33','2012-10-06 23:40:37',0,'[\"\"]','[\"\"]','','2012-07-27 10:05:00','1970-01-01 05:35:00','ska-ska-ska-the-ska-vengers-bombay-bassment-blek-gandu-circus-delhi-sultanate-samara-c-bbc-at-blue-frog',1,NULL),(180,'Retro Night: The Other People + DJ Ruskin (Mumbai) ','Their shows cover a variety of genres ranging from Soft Rock to Rock \'n\' Roll, throwing in some Reggae mixed with a little Contemporary and some Retro, a touch of Blues, a shout of Pop and even a bit of some thumping Disco!

Consciously refusing to let themselves be fenced in by genres, they derive their sound from in?uences and inspirations ranging from Led Zeppelin, RHCP, and Dave Matthews to Rachmaninoff, Marley, and Django Reinhardt. In early 2007 the band made it to GIR with their track Overture to Outerspace, which subsequently launched them on a much vaster platform. They spent most of the following year touring the country, taking time out in June to appear on Channel [V]’s show Launch Pad. They wrapped ‘07 with a highly acclaimed unplugged performance in their city, Delhi, where their cover of Redemption Song stood out as one of the critics’ ?nest of the evening. Known for their antics on stage, HSD are perhaps as much the performers, as they are the musicians. With a hedonistic approach to music, they maintain an air of fun that remains a key quotient despite lineup changes and other minor disruptions. The nomenclature of the band is derived from the fact that the band tune their guitars a step down from standard tuning.

Qawwali is the most well known form of Sufi music, common in India and Pakistan. However, music is also central to the............ Sema cerem......ony of the whirling dervishes, which is set to a form of music called Ayin, a vocal and instrumental piece featuring Turkish classical instruments such as the ney (a reed flute). The West African gnawa is another form, and Sufis from Indonesia to Afghanistan to Morocco have made music central to their practises. Some of the Sufi orders have taken an approach more akin to puritan forms of Islam, declaring music to be unhelpful to the Sufi way. Sufi love songs are often performed as ghazals and Kafi, a solo genre accompanied by percussion and harmonium, using a repertoire of songs by Sufi poet.','','','','www.mypurplemartini.com',NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:33','2012-09-06 07:27:33',0,'','','','2012-07-13 08:35:00','1970-01-01 05:35:00','soulfull-sufi-night-by-dhwani-band',1,NULL),(199,' Nasya Band Live ','Nasya Band Live @ Power Play Sports Bar, Catch Nasya live on Saturday only at Power Play Sports Bar.

After winning several rock band competitions across Delhi like Jamia Hamdard, PGDAV, Dyal Singh and CVS to name a few, Nasya headlined at colleges like Miranda House and Lady Irwin College in 2009.

With over 10 million album sales and 30 produced mix compilations, John’s a proven musical pioneer whose essence lies in what his fans call, ‘the J00F sound’. The J00F sound is as unpretentious as the artist, and is best described as deep and textured progressively edged trance, in an electronic dance music style that is an antithesis to what is normally produced within the genre.\r\n\r\nIn an industry rife in self worship and mirror gazing, John is characterised by a passion and ability to connect audiences by injecting his unique underground musical style, and not his ego, into the mainstream vein. This connection has manifested in ten mix compilations and five singles in the UK Top 40 charts on iconic labels: Virgin, EMI and Warner Music. It has also seen him headline major events worldwide, seeing in over 10,000 appearances at the likes of Gatecrasher, Godskitchen, Ministry of Sound and Global Gathering, through to Holland’s Dance Valley, Serbia’s Exit Festival, Brazil’s Exxxperience, Australia’s Future music festivals, Belgium’s Tomorrowland, and the U.S.A’s Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC).\r\nJohn’s renown lies in his desire to give back to his fans. His much lauded 2010 BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix has spawned J00F Editions, an international tour which innovatively refocuses the music onto the club and its clubbers. J00F Editions resurrects the scene of old, and reintroduces the clubbing experience to extended sets, new sounds and new artists to deliver a true musical journey devoid of fluff and predictive cliché that has quickly gained international respect, residencies and support from other leading figures such as Dave Seaman, Avalon, Passion and Ministry of sound. JOOF Editions has been a huge success.\r\n\r\nJohn’s record label, J00F Recordings, and his monthly radio show, Global Trance Grooves, broadcast on iTunes, Ministry of Sound radio and DI. FM provides John another path to walk his own line. Here, he promotes rising stars in addition to giving over four million subscribed fans the latest in J00F’s inimitable sounds.\r\n\r\nJohn is also one of a select few endorsed by Pioneer. As the industry heavyweights inside every DJ booth, John provides subject matter expertise and consultancy in a partnership which ensures the upward evolution of the electronic music world’s tools of the trade.\r\n\r\nJohn’s esteem within the industry has garnered respect from electronica luminaries like Jean Michael Jarre and Simple Minds, and while humbly accepting peer endorsement he continues to let his production skills do the talking. Being humble John has never bragged the fact he writes music scores for the TV and movie world having music all over; BBC, NBC, Warner bros, Sony, ABC, Fax and more. Often being disgruntled with the commercial intrusion into the electronic John saved his writing skills for the media word, until recently where he has released an onslaught of chart topping releases, including his award winning debut album ‘Nine lives’ in 2011.\r\n\r\nJohn 00 Fleming is a performer who adroitly crafts something musically organic from the inorganic, artfully opening your senses into a genre far more pervasive than you currently know. Challenge yourself, and get intelligently immersed, inside his adventurous odysseys.','','','','www.indivibe.com',NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:33','2012-09-06 07:27:33',0,'','','','2012-07-13 08:05:00','1970-01-01 05:35:00','eclipse-presents-john-00-fleming-with-dj-pearl',1,NULL),(209,'JULLIET FOX, VIPUL & DRUM ATTIC','A dynamic DJ, producer and radio presenter, Juliet Fox has been involved in music throughout most of her life.\r\n\r\nShe expresses herself through track selection and crowd interaction, and has become a favourite for Australian club nights, gigs and events over the past few years.

Marlon was already DJ\'ing and Ralph experimented a lot with making different kinds of dance music. Marlon was mainly playing house at the time. The original idea was simply to push Ralph’s productions in a similar direction allowing Marlon to play the tracks out in his sets. The first track they were both satisfied with was ‘Beat Cut’.\r\n\r\nTheir big break came in 2011 when their dance floor bomb ‘Mush Mush’ got picked up by Tiësto and got released on Tiësto’s imprint ‘Musical Freedom’. It dominated the Beatport Top 10 for over 2 months and grew to be one of the biggest club/festival tracks of 2011.

If there is one thing Tip’s is happy doing it is singing and reflecting this, she vocalizes with a joy and exuberance that is unmatched and original.

It was just a matter of time before practically every college and concert promoter in the country wanted to book what had become India’s favourite band. The rest is history.

Inspired by Shakti, the influential indo jazz ensemble of John McLaughlin and Zakir Hussain, Max started learning about the Indian system of raga and tala with violinist Indradeep Ghosh. In October 2009 he enrolled at Sangit Mahabharati Music School in Mumbai (Bombay) to study Indian Classical Music with Pandit Nayan Ghosh. \r\n\r\nBesides his studies Max regularly performs in India and Europe in a solo format and with musicians like Indradeep Ghosh (violin), Hindol Deb (sitar), Nirmalya Roy, Omprakash Pandey, Niraj Kumar, Pt Shankha Chatterjee (tabla), Torsten de Winkel (guitar), Rafael Sotomayor (hang), Marc-Inti Männel (bass), Vaibhav Wavikar and Geronimo Dehler (perc).\r\n\r\nIn 2010, luthier Philipp Neumann and Max designed a double neck acoustic guitar equipped with 12 sympathetic strings. The Lotus Guitar, named after stylized lotus petals on the body and neck of the guitar, is a unique instrument providing an incredible variety of colours from warm nylon string sounds to oud or sarod-like microtonal shades to the silvery ring of the sympathetic strings. The Lotus Guitar has been a great success so far, being used regularly in Max\'s performances, including his India tour in January 201','','','','http://www.bluefrog.co.in/events/max-clouth-trio',NULL,NULL,'2012-09-06 07:27:33','2012-09-06 07:27:33',0,'','','','2012-08-29 10:05:00','1970-01-01 05:35:00','max-clouth-clan-friends',1,NULL),(363,'Ankur & The Ghalat Family','After rocking many gigs at blueFROG Bombay, Ankur Tewari and his family of musical friends are all set for their debut performance at blueFROG Delhi!

Yet, Angaraag Mahanta, son of singers Khagen Mahanta and Archana Mahanta, has managed to create a separate identity with his debut album Jonaki Raati, which recently hit the stalls in Assam. Papon Papon(Angaraag Mahanta) singer. composer, programmer, producer-born in assam to set of brilliant musicians, was introduced to music and its intricacies in his early childhood. His mother ARCHANA MAHNATA and father KHAGEN MAHANTA are two very popular and respected musicians of the region. Naturally, music has been there in his veins, his pulse as well as his ears since he was born. BOrn in the environment of music and musical performances his initiantion into music happened at an age when most people learn to talk or walk. Inspired by the wide array of sound that he has been exposed to from the traditional Vaishnavite devotional songs of Assam to new-age electronica, Papons music is new and free. Free to be confined by any genre and new to be identified with anything that already exists. His initial training has been in Indian classical and traditional music (devotional and folk) from Assam a region in the north eastern corner of India, sharing its borders and culture with the very oriental - Bhutan, China, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Papons boundary-free renditions have definite traces of pentatonic Mongoloid notes, the soul searing lyrical river songs, the rhythmic spring songs, the spiritual devotional songs, restrained Indian classical and the smooth-as-mature-wine ghazals. His innovative experiments are rich with ambient electronica, acoustic folk, electro ghazals, new-age, Ind-classical sounds. papon had released his first album \'jonaaki raati\' in assamese.- the language he was born to and is working on his hindi album. Lately he is doing vocal jams with MIdiVal punditz and with Susmit Sen of INDIAN OCEAN\'. He has recently completed the back ground score for the film.... Papon has been invited to New Zealand for the Crossings festival, where some of the finest and established New Zealand jazz artists from the band Onomatopoeia will Accompaning him on his songs from his forthcoming hindi album. Also playing with him will be one of the biggest electonica musician Rhian Sheehan. \"In \'Jonaki Raati\' each one of the eight numbers is fresh both in content and rendition. Angaraag seems to be completely uninfluenced by his illustrious parents. Another significant aspect of the album Jonaaki Raati is that at no moment the singer uses tricky notes or complex musical structure,which could have overpowered the touchy lyrics. Angaraag has clearly moved deeper and touched the very essence of the lyrics.This undoubtedly is a rare piece in the contemporary Assamese modern song scenario. Angaraag indeed has a long musical sojourn to undertake. All he needs is to maintain his own concept and style of rendition.....\"..The Telegraph. Angaraag Mahanta\'s Junaki Raati Currently Anagraag has started a new band named \"East India Company\" along eight other talented musicians around various corners of India. The band is concentrating on a new blend of traditional and folk music, which is already able make a mark to the audiences across the world.','','','','http://www.bluefrog.co.in/calendar-delhi',NULL,NULL,'2012-09-11 12:16:32','2012-10-08 02:18:31',0,'[\"\"]','[\"\"]','','2012-09-27 21:30:00','2012-09-27 23:00:00','papon-the-east-india-company',1,NULL),(558,'Ladies Night with DJ Leon Russell','Mid-week is the perfect time to get those heels out and let your hair down!

Martini Friday\'s','In a movement that may surprise some, a fresh new wave of DJs and\r\nproducers are bursting forth from the burgeoning house music scene in\r\nIndia and making an international impact. For a country well-known for\r\nits rich culture and unique musical forms, electronic music has not\r\nbeen seen to make much of an impact. This is about to change with the\r\nadvent of a thriving electronic dance and house scene in India\'s major\r\ncities. A special part of this is a DJ/producer named Vipul.\r\nVipul was heavily influenced by DJs and artists such as Darin\r\nEpsilon, Sasha , John Digweed, Robert Babicz, Chris Micall, Audiofly\r\nand Tim Davison. Vipul\'s sets are open to many different styles and\r\ngenres. He has found himself working mostly in a very funky,\r\ntech-house sound that also draws on jackin\' and hypnotic elements. His\r\nprowess behind the decks quickly \r\nearned Vipul a residency at one of\r\nthe major clubs in Delhi where he was \r\nable to play across the entire\r\nrange of house music. Vipul soon found \r\nhimself booked with more\r\nwell-known DJs like Tim Davison, Dr \r\nNorman Doray , Inland Knights ,\r\nDr.Kucho , Alex Niggemann , Rainer \r\nWeichhold , etc .It was this\r\nacquaintance with Hamza, the founder \r\nof India\'s premier house music\r\nlabel Wind Horse Records, that proved \r\nmost consequential.\r\nBefriending Hamza not only opened \r\nVipul to different sounds and styles\r\nin DJ\'ing, but Hamza\'s critique and \r\nencouragement greatly influenced\r\nthe growth of Vipul\'s studio output. \r\nSoon Vipul was creating tracks\r\nthat impressed Hamza enough to \r\nwelcome the young producer to the \r\nWind\r\nHorse family. In due time, Vipul honed his cross-genre sound, drawing\r\nupon elements of progressive and deep house. He started gaining notice\r\nwith his production efforts earning great feedback from top DJ names\r\nin the industry. Vipul\'s first track, \"Persian Love,\" was repeatedly\r\nplayed out by artists like Tocadisco , Blank and Jones , and\r\nMuzikjunki. In India \"Persian Love\" become quite popular, and Vipul\r\ngained a satisfying recognition in his home country. Outside of India,\r\nVipul\'s rising profile resulting in opportunities to contribute music\r\nto global labels such as Subtract music ,Sick Watona, 925 Digital, Whose Haus, \r\nLowbit, Endemic Digital, Budenzauber, City Life, Virtual Love, 3AM Recordings, \r\nFreizeitglauben Berlin and more.\r\nVipul\'s star continues to rise with more DJ dates throughout Indiaand abroad, future studio collaborations and accomplishments, and a\r\ncontinuing influential role in Wind Horse Records. His upcoming\r\nprojects include many new original tracks, a collaboration with\r\nrenowned Argentinian Ricky Ryan. Not everyone can claim to be as\r\ninsightful as an Indian astrologer, but it is easy to see that Vipul\'s\r\nbright future in house music is assured.','','https://www.facebook.com/events/382430568496210/','','',NULL,NULL,'2012-09-14 15:52:36','2012-09-14 15:53:42',0,'[\"\"]','[\"\"]','','2012-09-14 20:00:00','2012-09-14 01:00:00','blend-pres-martini-fridays',2,NULL),(601,'Faridkot Live at Blue Frog','Rock to the tunes of Faridkot , A \"CONFUSED\" Pop band , as they call themselves at The Blue Frog probably for the last time ever as they\'ve announced their disbandment.','','http://www.facebook.com/events/318343738263632/','','http://www.facebook.com/events/318343738263632/',NULL,NULL,'2012-09-17 10:42:27','2012-09-17 10:42:27',0,'[\"\"]','[\"\"]','','2012-09-18 22:00:00','2012-09-18 10:40:00','faridkot-live-at-blue-frog',1,NULL),(602,'JBC presents Peter Cat Recording Co, InXhale, Jokers Night and The Dirty Strikes Public Event','Jumping Bean Cafe brings to you the acclaimed band \"Peter Cat Recording Co\" all the way from New Delhi.

It’s just two musicians – Ananth Menon and Vasudev Prabhu, with an abiding passion for a genre of music that is deeply and subliminally connected to almost every form of Western music that one hears today. \r\n\r\nA classic ‘guitar-harmonica duo’, Ananth and Dev have set out to pay their tribute to the blues, in many ways the ‘haiku’ of the West, in their own home-grown style. Ananth lays down the gritty grooves with his guitar and tops it with a voice that is like fine whisky – smooth, mellow and welcome. Over this potent combination, the wailing harmonica dances like country rain on a tiled roof… drizzling steadily and gently, and bursting into a fierce downpour at times.\r\n\r\nBy2Blues is a Bangalore-based duo influenced as much by the classic post-war era music as by other genres like R&B, Country Blues, Soul, Blues-rock, Gospel, Funk and Rock n Roll. Naturally, in their performances one hears a spirited amalgam of all these genres as they engage the audience in stories of love won or lost, struggles and triumphs, hoodoo and miracles, honesty and skullduggery, bonhomie and despair… because that’s what life is all about.\r\n\r\nBy2Blues works best in a setting that is personal and mature; Ananth and Dev have performed at several festivals individually and as a band, as well as at popular watering holes in Bangalore.

Her father, a famous senior DJ of Hungarian nightlife (DJ BANDERAS) introduced her to all kinds of music and taught her how to spin vinyls when she was still a teenager and most of all to understand that being a DJ means more than just to blend two tracks together. In other words, Kekka grew up with music and developed a deep love and huge understanding about music and the essentials and techniques of professional Djing.\r\n\r\nShe would describe herself as being pierced by rhythm all over her body!\r\n\r\nStarting out as a professional model in 2005, she quickly made her way into the international model scene and was soon glancing from several covers of the most important magazines and fashion lectures. Becoming PLAYMATE of the year 2006 for the Hungarian Playboy and 2007 for the Italian issue of the infamous mag are considered as milestones of her modeling career.\r\n\r\nSoon bored by the monotony of \"just\" being a model, where she achieved a lot already, she felt like looking for another aim in entertainment and decided to follow her father\'s footsteps in becoming a DJ. 2009 and 2010 Djane Kekka was booked in almost every club in Hungary and Italy and soon invited to perform abroad.\r\n\r\nTouring the US with stops in New York, Las Vegas, Miami and Boston was a great experience in her young career and more international appearances came soon. Joining the roster of an all female agency which specializes in the exciting and ever growing Asian market-- led her to great gigs in Dubai, Indonesia, Vietnam, Jordan, Pakistan, Syria, Lebanon, just to name a few.\r\n\r\nKekka was touring official FASHION TV Asia gigs and invited to debut her show for grand openings of high profile Asian clubs. Recently Djane Kekka toured an all summer tour in Hungary and Spain again and is to guest in the South of Germany.\r\n\r\nProducing music by herself, she expresses that her definition of House and Electro music is one of the greatest things to do for her. Delivering remixes for several artists in 2011 plus the release of her own track/remixes which ranked high at all download portals just goes to show that there is much potential and you can be sure to hear much more from this promising talent.\r\n\r\nHer set’s essence is a fine blend of vocal-based Electro and Tech House, sometimes twisted with a massive bassline close to Progressive.','','http://www.facebook.com/events/470296823014412/','','http://www.facebook.com/events/470296823014412/',NULL,NULL,'2012-09-18 15:05:30','2012-09-18 15:05:30',0,'[\"\"]','[\"\"]','','2012-09-18 20:00:00','2012-09-18 23:45:00','tantra-budweiser-present-djane-kekka',1,NULL),(633,'Ma Faiza at Blue Frog','Born in Africa, Ma Faiza is one of the busiest and most successful DJs in India.

Whether it’s the thousands of A&B fans singing their lyrics back at them in concert halls from Beirut to Brixton, or the millions that tune in for their weekly TATW radio show, connection – real human connection - is at the heart of all things that define Above & Beyond.\r\nMuch like acts like The Smiths or Joy Division before them, Above & Beyond find themselves embedded at the heart of their fan’s lives. Some walk down the wedding isle to their songs, others ink their bodies with their lyrics, often a proud couple will choose to get engaged at one of their gigs. All that pledge their loyalty to them, are moved in a way that goes beyond most electronic music out there.\r\n\r\nAbove & Beyond is Jono Grant, Tony McGuinness and Paavo Siljamaki and their story is one of constant movement. From their early days as hotly tipped producers to their current global standing, Jono, Tony and Paavo have remained as down-to-earth and determined as ever – always focused on the next goal. Over their 11-year history, this dedication has continually paid off. \r\n\r\nThe only dance act in history to win the Essential Mix Of The Year twice (for both their 2004 and 2011 efforts), the London-based trio have remixed greats like Radiohead and Madonna, played to one million people on the Barra Beach in Rio de Janiero (New Year’s Eve in 2007) and even had their track “Buzz” chosen to soundtrack the launch of Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo in the Mojave desert.And as these landmarks rack up, the non-stop pulse of their global touring keeps them connected to their growing international fanbase. Each week brings another crowd, another country and often another continent, while their weekly TATW radio show now reaches over 30 million people worldwide.\r\nA band first and foremost, Above & Beyond are songwriters as much as they are DJs and their second album “Group Therapy” has taken their sound to new heights. The follow-up to 2006’s widely acclaimed debut “Tri-State”, the album draws on musical reference points as diverse as French cosmic pop heroes Air, American singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley and soundtrack master Hans Zimmer. “We are always looking to explore new territory but try to operate in our own way rather than just trying to follow trends,” explains Jono. The combined result on “Group Therapy” was unmistakably Above & Beyond – a cohesive album that was described by Mixmag as “the artist album of the year”. \r\n\r\nAt the heart of the album’s allure, of course, were songs of loves lost, confused and found; sung by the distinctive Richard Bedford and former Faithless singer/songwriter Zoë Johnston. “Songs have an impact which is quite unparalleled in art,” believes Tony. “Poetry can be powerful, great literature is another great informer and educator, but few of us can remember any significant words from the great books or poems we read. But something amazing happens when you put words to music.”\r\nFeaturing two BBC Radio 1 playlisted singles (“Sun & Moon” and “Thing Called Love”) and a Sirius BPM Chart #1, the album’s many songs have connected in a way that so few dance tracks – vocal or otherwise – ever manage. “Since releasing our Group Therapy Album last year, it\'s brought us even closer to our audience around the world,” explains Paavo. “The one thing I didn\'t expect to happen on the scale it has, is how people from around the world have shared their stories with us as they go through amazingly positive or incredibly difficult times in their lives. It\'s really touched us all and feels like a driving force for new creativity.”\r\n\r\nIn the months since its release, the intense atmosphere at Above & Beyond’s increasingly ambitious live performances has redrawn the parameters of the DJ set. While so many superstar DJs place themselves at the heart of their performance, Above & Beyond’s focus is always on getting closer to their crowd and making them part of the action. Whether that is by bringing fans up on stage to press the play button on their CDJs or communicating with the fans via their visual screens, the effect is to make everyone in the room feel like they are part of an experience that is at once epic, immersive and interactive.\r\n\r\n“Some time ago we realised that on the best nights we have it\'s always a three way thing: us, the music and the people, and we see improving the communication between all three as helping a good party turn incredible, “ explains Paavo. “The soundsystem, lights and visuals are all there to help people connect to the music, with each other and with us better. A Group Therapy experience, ideally, is positive, uniting and life-affirming for all involved.”\r\n\r\nThroughout this process, Above & Beyond have continued to release forward-thinking instrumental club music – such as their own tech-fused rollercoaster “Formula Rossa” – on their renowned Anjunabeats label. An essential part of their story, the label is now in its 11th year and has helped to nurture artists like the London-based innovator Mat Zo, the eclectic genius Andrew Bayer and Russian star Arty. Independently spirited but run with ambitious vision, the label has grown like a family.“Dance music tends to be very short term, but we aim to release records that will leave a lasting impression on people and are listened to in years to come” explains Jono. “We try to operate in our own way rather than trying to follow trends.” \r\n\r\nLike just about everything they turn their attentions to, it is labour of love as well as a collaboration of the trio’s energies. De La Soul weren’t wrong. Three is the magic number. And in Above & Beyond’s case, the magic is spreading faster than ever before.','http://www.aboveandbeyond.nu/','','','http://www.aboveandbeyond.nu/',NULL,1,'2012-09-28 04:36:47','2012-10-11 12:23:53',48,'[\"\"]','[\"\"]','','2012-11-10 04:35:00','2012-11-10 04:35:00','above-beyond-group-therapy-world-tour',3,NULL),(700,'JUNKYARD GROOVE (LIVE) at CounterCulture','Junkyard Groove was formed in the year 2005 and have become a main stay in the Indian Independent music scene.\r\n\r\nA band that has seen every high and low of being in a band, from being signed to an international label, opening for some of the biggest bands in the world (Iron maiden, Incubus, Prodigy, Robert Plant and more), to being dropped from their label, and going through line up changes.\r\n\r\nTheir first album 11:11 was a huge success garnering a big fan base and winning quite a few awards.

An ongoing monthly series, it will exclusively host international headliners all representing genres such as drum and bass, dubstep and glitch.\r\n\r\nIt comes as no surprise then that their first headliner choice kick starting the series is Manchester based drum and bass producer Dub Phizix. A producer that over the last year has dominated the drum and bass scene from the very moment the world first viewed the promo video to his December 2011 release \'Marka\' (video below). Penned by Dub Phizix alongside regular collaborator Skeptical with guest vocals from Strategy, \'Marka\' adhered to no known recent stylistic formulas. Easily the drum and bass track of 2011, \'Marka\' married staccato dancehall like rhythms with slamming bass hits and Strategys unintelligible but potent rhymes.\r\n\r\nWith a back-catalogue now spanning over 10 years, Dub Phizix has released music on high profile and respected labels such as Exit, Commercial Suicide, Soul:R, Critical, Dispatch and Ingredients with Mixmag calling his music \'Essential material\'. Although he may be a fresh face to many, Dub Phizix\' DJ sets always display his depth of knowledge of what makes a great drum and bass track, mixing up often neglected classics with the freshest upfront material.\r\n\r\nOver the coming months Dub Phizix has much anticipated releases on Exit Records, Creative Source, Commercial Suicide, Innerground, Samurai Music and many more. 2011 may be the year that the world truly discovered Dub Phizix, but 2012 is set to be the year he reaches his full potential blazing a trail of innovation across the history of drum and bass music.\r\n\r\nThe full line up and dates for Octobers edition of BASS CAMP Festival can be seen below:\r\n\r\n26 October / blueFROG Mumbai\r\n\r\nDub Phizix\r\nBASSFoundation // Big Daddy Klein & Delhi Sultanate\r\nJazzsteppa (DJ)\r\nOx7gen\r\n\r\n27 October / blueFROG New Delhi\r\n\r\nDub Phizix\r\nBASSFoundation // Big Daddy Klein & Delhi Sultanate\r\nJazzsteppa (DJ)\r\nTarqeeb\r\nMr. Herbalist\r\nSwaggamuffin','http://www.bluefrog.co.in/calendar-delhi','http://www.facebook.com/events/537017326315567/','','http://www.bluefrog.co.in/calendar-delhi',NULL,1,'2012-10-07 04:07:44','2012-10-08 02:50:58',91,'[\"\"]','[\"\"]','','2012-10-26 04:05:00','2012-10-27 04:05:00','bass-camp-festival-dub-phizix-bassfoundation-jazzsteppa-more-at-blue-frog',3,NULL),(733,'SEAN PAUL India Tour at HUDA GROUNDS','Sean Paul, the Jamaican star whose 2003 Dutty Rock album brought dancehall to the charts, will be playing shows in India this November.

Given the many problems they have faced in running a business in Nagaland, which is still a struggling developing state, they have managed to maintain their quality in the business and promise to hold onto it. The café has come a long way from not just being a place for excellent continental fast food but also a hub for Live Music with their Friday Night Live held every second Friday of the month and special guest bands from across India performing at the café. This has put the café in the limelight especially across North-Eastern India and has gained them immense recognition and appreciations amongst the music fanatics since there aren’t many such places present at the moment. Through Jumping Bean Café musicians across the North-East regions are able to reach out to a bigger audience and make music a profession. The café not only provides a platform for professional musicians and bands but also opens its doors to amateur or upcoming artists that want to get more recognition. The genre of music played in the café is unlimited and varies from jazz/blues to heavy metal/rock or reggae/hip-hop. The café has also opened a Comic/Anime DVD section where you can get a wide selection of some of the popular comic characters seen and read across the world. With their laid back ambience and warm customer service the café is a favorite amongst young and old who want to have a quiet moment to themselves or catch up with loved ones over a hot cup of coffee or a steamy bowl of noodles on a cold chilly day or chill out with a tall ice tea or their famous rainbow soda in the hot sweltering days.

The music at Rhino blends in and does not overwhelm the revelers. It rather provides enough space for sharing a thought or a conversation. Anyone and everyone who is deeply connected to music would love to visit Rhino for its vast variety. It’s an amalgamation of different individuals finding their own unique world with different music experiences.\r\nInspired by the Rhino, the clubs philosophy, aesthetics and its identity was conceptualized to evoke a feeling of earthy, raw solidity with a timeless appeal.\r\n\r\nTo this end, extensive use of natural materials was made, with minimal treatment to allow the innate character of the material speak for itself. A palette of wood, iron, copper and granite was juxtaposed with elegant touches of lighter materials like rope, fabric and screens to create interest. The ambience thus provides the right balance of stimuli and comfort.\r\n\r\nRhino is designed as an exciting journey through a volumetric play of spaces – the journey begins from the moment you step under the mammoth light feature which overlooks the dynamic double height area with a stage for live performances. This leads to an intimate single height area with the bar-overlooking the lush outdoors, and finally a relaxing outdoor dining area with one of the best views over the city.
