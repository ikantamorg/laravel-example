# Musejam Documentation

Welcome to Musejam! You are a lucky developer who is about to work with a team using nothing less than cutting-edge web development tools, techniques, and software.

Please follow the links on the left for documentation on working with the project.

We **urge** you to read carefully, and *please* notify us of mistakes by either [raising an issue](https://github.com/Musejam/mj-app/issues/new), or *even better*, fixing the problems/typos and committing to your branch so we can merge it later (yes, we know we don't fork yet, we'll try and fix that soon).

These docs are biased from the perspective of a developer using Windows (7, but only for development). Feel free to add more egalitarian instructions!
